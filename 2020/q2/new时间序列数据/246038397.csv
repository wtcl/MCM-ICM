The original maker of this design is The First Years, not Avent.  So when I saw this on the shelf, I was misled because Phillips Avent is making a pacifier which looks exactly like the green pacifier that First Years used to make.  This may not be a big deal to anyone else (or their baby), but my baby knew the difference & wanted nothing to do with the Avent brand paci.  When I compared the two, I noticed that the Avent brand paci was slightly harder than The First Years brand.  With The First Years, my baby could chomp down easier & get better suction too.  Our hospital gave out The First Years brand, and that is all my daughter will take now.  At 4 months old, this particular brand did not work for us, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you.  But if your baby is picky, I would stick to the original brand if you know that's what (s)he likes.<br /><br />Note: Though she always prefers her green First Years brand, now at 9 months, baby is accepting the Avent brand.<br /><br />UPDATE:  FIRST YEARS does not make this paci at all anymore.  It seems AVENT has the manufacturing  rights.<br />My original review of this product is a bit old.  I want to say that the green pacifiers have been great, and of all the ones on the market, this is the only one she will take... even if there was a small adjustment period when the new brand took over.  I think it's important to note that the 0-3 Months pacifiers are preferable to her because they are softer.  When I tried buying the paci for older babies, she spit it out & simply could not get good suction.  It seemed too hard & uncomfortable for her.  Anyway, at 18 months old, she was still using this green 0-3 month paci, and we will ween her off the paci soon.  Right now it's a great soother while she is teething, as nothing else works.  I do believe though, that the shape of the nipple on this paci has caused her front teeth to grow inpronounced curve shape.",2011-03-31,0.138074695366362,0.4518182820266154,2028,0.3542626042288287,0.1468644614899671,0.002341132374957736

We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.

She is exclusively breastfed and we were worried about nipple confusion if we used a pacifier.  Using our finger was often inconvenient so we eventually decided to give the pacifier a try.  It did calm her right away and I liked that the design was shaped slightly like a breast nipple.    The pacifier did change her latch slightly so we try to use it as little as possible.  The biggest down side for us was that she can't keep it in her mouth.  It falls out or she spits it out every few minutes and starts crying until we put it back in.  For her the MAM style of pacifier worked better...it didn't rub on her chin and she was able to keep it in her mouth.  I think the Avent Soothie works ok, and may work well for another child.

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months.

Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap.

They're a great bargain and the pink and purple are adorable since we have a little girl and these also stand up just fine in the sterilizing process. Highly recommend purchasing these and a pacifier clip- if your child uses a pacifier a pacifier clip is a must have unless you want to constantly be searching for one or washing it because it fell on the floor! Definitely makes life easier to have a clip and an extra pack of these around, just in case.",2014-06-03,0.1058100233100233,0.4658974358974358,858,0.2699654070233817,1.0,0.19755905451799868

I know that sounds bad but this is why.... Nipple confusion! These closely resemble mom's and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped. I don't let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the &#34;orthodontic&#34; aspect doesn't really apply. Even if you're formula feeding, most of the bottles like Avent, Gerber or even Medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same.<br />In the other reviews I read, I saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit.<br />Here's a solution..!<br />I haven't found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for Soothies. They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!",2015-08-27,0.1052012471655328,0.5139455782312926,1816,0.2684516779632409,0.1,0.026797485437893676
