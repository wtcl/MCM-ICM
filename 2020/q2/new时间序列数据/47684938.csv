It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.

Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time.

This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers.

It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm.

I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.",2011-06-05,0.1586309523809523,0.4324735449735449,1626,0.367210678976155,0.1,0.021109056367121293

Great for at home or on the road.","I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side.

Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",2012-12-22,0.1473798328108673,0.5553482484948001,2440,0.2965708564404521,0.6,0.1300047810428289

It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.

My hair feels a lot softer and not burnt, so the lower heat seems to be fine.  Ive only had it a month, so I cant say how long the cord retract works.  For $20, if it lasts a year its better than the competition.  I was looking at other hair dryers, and 10$ more, 20$ more-- didnt seem to be much of a difference.  Not until you go to $100+, and when your comparing a 100$ hair dryer to a 20$ one, the 20$ one is the hairdryer to go with.  Update: retractable cord doesn't always fully retract. Still works fine.
