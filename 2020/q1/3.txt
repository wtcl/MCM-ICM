Thought it was going to be more powerful... I had a Conair YellowBird Pro which is an awesome dryer. I had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack. Thought I would upgrade, and this BlackBird seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />It's not a bad dryer. I'm thankful it is 2000 Watts. But, it doesn't seem to move the air as strong as my YellowBird does. It seems a little underpowered, I'm still going to search for perhaps a 2200 Watt dryer, if I can find one. I want a dryer that has more power, not necessarily more heat.<br /><br />Heat settings are good- the highest heat is quite hot. I use the second-highest setting. It's nice to also have a no-heat setting. But the no-heat only works on low power, with is useless. Next time, I'll make sure that I get the Conair that has the Cool-shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high.<br /><br />Not a bad dryer- does the job, and certainly better that the 1875 Watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore. Consider a different model if airspeed is important to you.
Not very portable. This dryer was disappointing. Although it folds for travel, the cord attachment increases its overall size, making it clumsy and hard to pack.  The power switch sticks, making it difficult to turn on/off.
Very light & dries fast but other claims exaggerated I first saw this hair dryer on a TV show talking about beauty products used by the stars.  Then I noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand.  His observations were the same as mine.  If you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue, this is a very good purchase.  But your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers.
Was a winner until the heating element gave out too quickly I鈥檓 always in search of a hair dryer that can blow dry my thick, curly hair as well as my stylist does. (I know 鈥?I know 鈥?it鈥檚 the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it 鈥?I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.<br /><br />This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).<br /><br />All of them have:<br />  * Same wattage<br />  * Three heat settings<br />  * Two speed settings<br />  * Cool shot feature<br />  * Diffuser and concentrator attachments<br />  * Ionic technology<br />  * Ceramic technology<br />  * Hanging loop<br /><br />The Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn鈥檛 say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.<br /><br />The Revlon鈥檚 concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington鈥檚 fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.<br /><br />All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say 鈥渕ay鈥?because the difference wasn鈥檛 large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.<br /><br />The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it鈥檚 the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.<br /><br />I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.<br /><br />I鈥檝e yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That鈥檚 the whole point of going curly 鈥?not having to do any hair drying. As for noise 鈥?I can鈥檛 answer which one is quietest because I鈥檓 deaf. It鈥檚 not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)<br /><br />The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn鈥檛 perform as well as the DC.<br /><br />Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference.

Good product, but not a long shelf life The vacuum works nice - catches the cut hair and it is easy to empty the collection space. Cuts hair as advertised, and has the usual snap on attachments. Lasted a year, then quit with no warning. $22 + shipping.
Not Exactly as Pictured What is not immediately discernible from the supplied photos is that the intake bezel and control buttons are all molded in bright pink pearl-colored plastic. That, and the fact that the box is printed in a all-over floral pattern tells me that this item is targeted toward the women's market. I ended up returning it.
Good for travel if you don't mind the noise level This little dryer works well as a travel dryer, especially since it folds. However, as with most small dryers, the noise it makes is pretty horrifying - loud loud loud.
Nanoe Yes; Plastic No I tested this hair dryer against two older models we have. One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it.

Handles well I bought this dryer based on other reviews that I read.  It's not heavy and it does a great job.  However, I should have read the product description in more detail--I did not notice it did not have a retractable power cord and it does not have a folding handle for easy storage.  I feel the design of the controls to be a bit flimsy--haven't had this style in the past.  Overall,  it does the job and it wasn't expensive.
Not really a travel dryer unless you travel big. Not really a travel dryer unless you travel &#34;big&#34;.
It was great, until the fireworks I've had this hairdryer for a year and a half.  I love the settings and how quickly it dries my hair.  It didn't last as long as I'd hoped, however.  It just started popping and shooting fire out of the end.
BIG dryer I bought this for the retractable cord. Hadn't bought a new dryer in years because I have short fine hair and don't need one much. But I got tired of having to wind up the cord all the time after I used my old small dryer for a minute. This dryer is meant for a serious blow dryer, I think. Someone who has a lot of hair and needs drying power. Be aware that this machine is big and heavy. I don't need such a powerful machine, My mistake I guess, but threw away the box before I realized. Seems very well made, but I wish I had something lighter. With a retractable cord.
Three Stars Gets the job done. Downfall is the bonnet connection keeps popping off so you must keep reattaching it.
Good hairdryer, but best for short or fine hair. First the positive: this hairdryer is just the right weight, not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either. The color of the model I got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful. The cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far, after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well. it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power. I definitely wouldn't call it ultra powerful. I have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful. It dries my shoulder length hair, start to finish in around 10 minutes. This conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair.<br />This hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish, or fine hair and are not in a rush. I will use it on weekends or evenings, but I don't want to get up 10-15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried.
Great hairdryer until something breaks [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]<br /><br />I bought this hairdryer from Amazon in July 2011 for $27.19 including the tax. It is now April 2012 and the cord stopped retracting. I just called Conair Customer Service and in order for them to repair it (at no charge), I must send it to them, at my own expense and must send them $7 for return shipping and they will repair it and return it to me.  I was going to do it, not having a clue what I would do without a hairdryer in the interim, when I checked Amazon again, and saw that I could buy a brand new one for $19.25 with no tax and, of course, free shipping. Obviously, that was the option I chose.<br /><br />Although I liked everything about this dryer, I find it very annoying that after only 9 months, I need to replace it. Anything similar in quality and features cost more money so now I will see how long this new one lasts.  This is very disappointing.
Newer isn't better I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week. The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount. Another piece of crap.
It works It works. just like the one it replaced.  First-time charging is quite slow, so be prepared.  Also the rubber coating on the last one of these I bought discolored quickly, and the one before that the coating became sticky after a while.  I am hoping this third one is better.
They shortened the cord to save a few pennies... not happy. My previous Vagabond, which I loved and traveled with for many years, finally kicked the bucket and I replaced it today with the current model. I was a little bummed that purple was no longer a color option (strange, since it is in the other Conair models), but was extremely upset to discover that the power cord is now a full six inches shorter! I couldn't believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot. This makes a huge impact on how far from the outlet I can stand while drying my hair and is incredibly annoying. Would have happily paid more for the longer cord. Very disappointed.
Just OK The dryer does an adequate job, but doesn't seem to generate the same level of heat that my previous 1875 watt dryer did. The attachment to direct the air flow also doesn't seem to work as well. I have been using this dryer for about six months, so I think I have had it plenty of time to get used to, but still I don't like it as well as my previous one.
Three Stars I like everything about it except for the night light.  It is too bright for me.
... size but the plastic gets very warm and seems like it could be a hazard after prolonged use Packs power for its size but the plastic gets very warm and seems like it could be a hazard after prolonged use.
Works fine but the switches are fiddly This is an ordinary hair dryer, and it works fine.  Not too heavy or inconvenient in any way except those switches which are kind of &#34;fiddly.&#34;  They have a loose, cheap feel, but it's not really a big problem.
incompatible power plug None available.
Bubble City The dryer works really well, but as other reviewers have indicated, the finish on the handle starts bubbling and peeling after about a month of use. It's annoying, but it does work. Too late to send it back and I'm not sending it to Conair with $5 to get it repaired.
Great until it wasn't. I liked this dryer a lot, and it was a great dryer for the price.  However, a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat.  Probably won't bother with this brand again, as I see the same thing has happended to other users.
Real Warranty/ From Amazon's description:  &#34;Guaranteed authentic. Never counterfeit. 4-year warranty.&#34;  When I went to fill out the warranty card it states One (1) year warranty only.  What happened to the other 3 years?  My wife likes it and would rate it 5 stars.
Does the job This does dry my hair.  It is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair!
Works ok, but kinda whiny. This dryer has good air velocity, but the air isn't as warm as I would like it to be. Also it has a higher pitch whine than I would have expected for a dryer of this size. I have a little portable dryer and this one sounds almost identical. I do love the retractable cord. It's nice not having a bunch of loose cord everywhere. I also like that it folds down to a smaller size for packing away.
This unit is no quieter than any other hair dryer I've heard except when it's off Other than that it's fine. I have one other minor objection. I mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side. There one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to. the light leak is something I could fix with RTV silicon, I just haven't bothered. A better design would include a case that fits better to it's base and doesn't leak light, and would also only have the light on when it's dark instead of all the time. Again, it's not quiet. We bought it for our guest bath, so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn't go deaf. No way I'd put up with this noise if it was our primary. This unit doesn't deserve to call itself quiet, so if you need quiet keep shopping.
Great until it broke This hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use. Still a pretty good price, but I won't buy the same item for fear that it will break again.
Too loud I bought this to replace a similar Andis dryer that I bought 2 years ago that konked out.  This one looked similar, but was much louder.  The old one was billed as being quiet; this one was not. A quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me, so now I am off to find one...
It does its job. It is an inexpensive dryer and it does its job with all the functions described. Nothing too fancy. I expect it to last for at least a couple of years.<br /><br />Update: I just deducted one star because it is too loud, louder than the average.
Three Stars Cord doesn't retract all the way
Too Darn Big This dryer might work wonderfully.  I wouldn't know.  It arrived and I opened it and was shocked at how big it was.  Much larger than the photo or specs indicated.  Not suitable for travel, but I can't comment on performance.
Srong Blow But Not Enough Heat (C+ Grade) This hair dryer has the makings of being a great one. It has a great blow, but it takes forever to heat up. After 10 minutes of use, the heat was still lacking, leaving my hair damp. I'd give this one a pass and not worth the money. Nice color though.<br /><br />Katiebabs
Average blow dryer It works OK. Easy to use. Nothing special about it.  It says for salon use but, it would take to long to dry Salon hair. I had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around $200 to replace it.  so, for the price of the MHD dryer it works just fine. It just takes longer.
This is a nice tiny size for traveling This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a &#34;cool shot&#34; button.
ok for the price but does not heat enough Frankly, I used to have a Conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one.  It barely could blow and definitely not hot enough.  I gave it to my mom since it's small and very light and she doesn't have much hair, but it was unusable for me.  Still searching for a good hair blower...
Three Stars mine was green
Basic Hair Dryer Love the metallic green, and the dryer ample job. The cold shot is also a helpful feature. However, I was expecting a much different hair dryer. The cord does not retract into the handle as advertised. Also, the dryer is much larger and heavier than I hoped it would be. It also would would have been nice to have the diffuser attachment to create funkier hair styles. The travel bag is well made. Truthfully, it's too big and heavy for me to use it for travel.
Has its Pros & Cons... After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn't make your hair look any nicer)<br />2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!<br />3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don't, and it really only gets in the way)<br />4. Hang loop<br />5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)<br />6. Outside stays cool to touch<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Heavier than the last two dryers we've had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).<br />2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers<br />3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)<br />4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.<br />5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.<br />6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time.
Has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying. Otherwise Bit on the noisy side. Has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying. Otherwise, nice and light weight.
Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one Small and light weight. Quiet, relative to our old one which was loud through the bathroom door. On low fan speed, it's very quiet, especially with the bathroom door closed. Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one. Black one is 22 bucks for some reason.  UPDATE: After ~14 months, the on/off switch started to malfunction. It's sticky and engages sometimes but mostly doesn't. Knocking off a star from 4-star to 3-star. This apparently is a common complaint. I took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and I haven't found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated. For the price, I'll probably just buy another because it's what works best for us in terms of power, quiet and weight.
quietER hair dryer When my toddler is sick with a cold, I don't want him to go to bed after his bath with towel dried, damp hair but he was afraid of our regular hair dryer. He is definitely less afraid of this one which is a huge plus. I use it myself and find that it doesn't take me any longer to dry my hair than usual. I also like that it is lightweight. I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem.
Hair dryer The dryer works just fine but the switches are ill-designed. The switches are located in an awkward position.    First:  the blue cool button is where your fingers rest so when you are drying hair and easily rest your fingers on the cool button, you blast the dryer on the cool setting.  This is very annoying and you have to get used to not pressing this button.    Second:  in order to turn on /off the dryer and turn the setting to how you want, you have to get used to doing it from an awkward position in the back of the handle where your fingers are holding the dryer.  Once you get used to it, it's not a big deal, but it's constantly annoying trying to turn on/off the dryer from this position.    The power of the dryer is great; it's powerful and the dryer works well but I wish the buttons were designed better so that I didn't always hit the cool button and that the on/off switch were easier to turn the blower on and off.
Three Stars Good when working.  Cord broke at handle in a few months
OK Cord doesn't retract very well
Larger than I thought Guess I should condier myself lucky, at least mine is working ... so far anyway! A lot bigger than I had hoped it would be. High speed has lots of volume, but doesn't seem as forceful as my last hair dryer. Guess some things require a visit to a real store. Otherwise, it's okay. Just hope it stays working.
Does not blow cool air at high speed I never want heat.<br />I just want cool air blowing hard.<br />But this dryer will not blow cool air on high speed.<br />It blows cool air softly just fine.<br />But, if you turn up the speed, then you get hot air.<br />So, for me, this dryer gets 1 star.<br />But, for the other people in my house who want hot air, it gets 5 stars.<br />So, I am settling on 3 stars.
I loved the idea that you could switch the voltage I loved the idea that you could switch the voltage, however, you only get the low speed. I have a lot of hair so it took forever to blow dry my hair. On a positive note, it is small and fits well into a carryon.
Not its predecessor I owned the model before this one for about 8 years. It was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day I bought it, until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower. Alas, it was a sad day. I specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other, and it's not lived up to par, by a long shot.<br /><br />I bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn't work. That's the WHOLE reason I wanted this model. This one is heavier, hotter, and the cool shot is really just warm. Not to mention, it's hot pink.<br /><br />In all, I'm very disappointed with this dryer, and will look for another retractable one next time. I don't recommend getting this one, if that is the feature luring you.<br /><br />--UPDATE - Sept 2014<br />This hairdryer totally died a month ago. I'd had it 18 whole months, and it completely quit working. No fireworks, no warning, just plugged it in, and nothing. I tried several outlets throughout the house, and it would. not. work.<br /><br />I contacted Conair, and based on its model number, which indicated it was well within warranty, they would replace it for free, sort of. I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last. That it works well is only part of what makes a product great. Longevity is part of the equation, as well.I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

Several Notches Above Your Average Junk Hair Dryer....Or is it? UPDATE 10-5-2011: This dryer went POP, began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes. To say it died is incorrect; I turned it off....permanently. It had a lifespan of three years and five months. Is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about $150.00? Not as far as I am concerned. My next investment in hair dryer futures?

Three Stars I expected it to be smaller.
Very large and heavy Heavy, big and burned out within 10 months of light use.
Not bad Have only used once but have high expectations.  Smell was not really so great but not horrible.  The after-tan smell (that burnt hair smell) was NOT BAD at all.  So well worth it there.  I could still smell it but it wasnt overpowering like most lotions are.  Gave me good color right out of the bed but not the best.<br /><br />I still think Worship Me does a MUCH better job giving you color right out of the bed...I looked like a goddess of the islands after using that just ONCE!  Also Worship Me smells better.  But meh, I'll try this and see.<br /><br />Hope it works!!!
A little bit too big for travel hairdrier My plans were to replace my travel hairdrier with this one but this one was bigger than mine.  The advantage I found is the noise. This hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important.  Would not work for me.  If size is not an issue this is a good purchase.
Cord is too short I like the power and feel of this dryer and the ionic conditioning does leave me with less frizz but the cord is too short.  I use an outlet near the floor and I have to use an extension cord or I can't maneuver above my head (and I'm only 5'5&#34;).  If your outlet is counter height it should be fine.
Cord too short Very powerful and very warm air.  I use it to dry my dog after a bath and the cord is just way t0o short compared to my last dryer.
Decent hair dyer but nothing special My old Conair ceramic hair dryer just died after about 4 yrs. Thought I would try this Ionic dryer. I've used it for about 3 wks now & have noticed no improvements to my hair. My hair is always shiny, so who can say? But as for frizzies or static hair, I have some issues & they were not improved by using this dryer. As others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using. You have to hold it by the sides only. Also the high speed is not much different from the low & neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer & many others I have had. But for what I pd it is a decent dryer. Nothing special, but it gets the job (of drying) done.
A good buy - and it lasted 5+ years The dryer is small but packs enough punch for my wife.  Installed the unit when we remodeled in 1998 and it just died this morning.  I'm buying another - since it will slide right into the space vacated by the old one I won't have any wallpaper issues to contend with and, for $20, its hard to beat the value.
Three Stars It works as expected.
Great, basic hair dryer... My only complaint is that there is not a hot/cool option, so it can get pretty hot, especially on the high setting.  Other than that, it's an inexpensive, quality hair dryer.
Nice dryer, If only it lasted more than one year I've been through 3 of this model dryer and each stopped working within 1 year.  Time to switch to another company. It's too bad because I really liked everything else about it.
Just an okay purchase Decent hairdryer, but doesn't really help my hair's tendency to frizz. Also don't like the placement of the &#34;cool&#34; button, I'm always pressing it accidentally. Overall, fine but wouldn't buy again.
Just Okay I like some heat from a hair dryer.  This one has a position that reads &#34;Hot&#34; but, it falls short of that. I'm assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of McDonald's coffee while using this hair dryer.  The buttons on the interior of the handle take some getting used to as your grip may have a tendency to change the heat setting or turn it off.  I'm adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part.
Overall; Disappointed Everything works as advertised, however, it did not meet my expectations.  I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz.  However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time.  Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair.  Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway.  The heat is not controlable, except for the COLD button you have to hold down to get just air.  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible.  I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off.  Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair.
Broken fan blades after 15 months Bought this for my wife, who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use. Most likely just one broke off, and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking. Now the dryer is worthless. The warranty was for one year, so no luck there, and replacement parts cannot be found. Maybe 15 months is OK for a hair dryer at this price point, I don't know. I'm buying another, and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time.
Andis Professional Dryer The first one I purchased had to be returned the same week.  We noticed that although it was turned off (but plugged in) it was extremely hot to the touch.  We had no problems whatsoever returning the product to Amazon.  I have received a replacement in the mail; however, I am a little afraid to use it and will be very certain to unplug it after usage.
It was great until it wasn't. I live at altitude in Colorado, and hair dryers can feel rather weak because there is less air to push through. This dryer is shaped for optimal delivery of air, and the airflow volume feels as powerful at altitude as most similarly priced consumer hair dryers at sea level. The retractable cord works well and makes the dryer packable for travel. I've been happy with this dryer for 9 months until today. I'm reducing the rating by 2 stars because the power switch failed and the only way to turn off the dryer is to unplug it. Could be worse, at least it still runs!
Fair It works ok but it's not the easiest drier to use. It has an odor to it and I wish it was just a little smaller in size
Ehhhh Worked ok for a year and then the high setting crapped out-Also a bit in the heavy side-I guess a percentage will be lemons like mine
Not for Amateurs If you are a master at wielding a blow dryer, you'll probably love this.  I find it too heavy and big for my hands when I am using the blow dryer to straighten my hair.  With that said, the various heat settings work well.  The concenrator attachments work fine for me.  I purchased this model in part for the comb attachment, but I can't manage the dryer properly with it attached.<br /><br />Update:  When I am not using the dryer to straighten my super curly hair, I like it.  My current hairstyle requires an hour under a bonnet dryer.  I can dry my hair in half the time using this hand-held dryer.
Good Product What can you say--it is a good product and does exactly what I wanted.  There are no bells and whistles, but I'm traveling.  I wanted something collapsable and easy to carry.  Although it's a tiny bit larger than I had hoped for, it is still better than my at home dryer.
but it has a single switch to select hi/low warm speeds or cool mode. The AC2015C has two switches From Ms. s1rude.<br />I've been using an older model Remington hairdryer for years, so I was able to compare this model to an another model of the same brand.<br />I don't have a model number on my current hairdryer because all of the writing has been rubbed off, but it has a single switch to select hi/low warm speeds or cool mode. The AC2015C has two switches, one allows you to select between three temperatures, the other between two speeds. There is a &#34;cool shot&#34; button. I have fine, straight shoulder length hair and don't really use my dryer for anything other than drying, so I've never understood the purpose of a cool shot button. Were I to use this function, I prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch, while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air. The AC2015C is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer, which I didn't care for. Pros of the AC2015C are that it is a nice looking dryer, and if its anything like my old Remington, it will probably last forever. For now I'm planning to stick with old reliable; its lighter and more straightforward.
Disappointing purchase I purchased this dryer to replace a 3-year-old Andis dryer that stopped working, and this one feels heavier, isn't as easy to use, and is not at all suitable for travel.  The heat and blower buttons are on two different panels, which some may like for the different possible combinations of settings but which I find difficult to adjust.  I'll keep it to use as a spare, but it's particularly disappointing because it was more expensive than my old dryer.
Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer I have had Conair soft bonnet hair dryers in the past with great success. This one performs ok with the one exception that the bonnet is not as large as in previous products. I have long hair and I use large rollers. I find that getting the bonnet over these rollers is a little more difficult. I also have to put a towel around the back of my neck to avoid excessive heat near the hose connection.
Good Enough This was easy to assemble. It feels sturdy. Everything works as it should. The only drawback is that all the air blows from the top, not the sides, so my hair dries unevenly. Also, the hood is rather long and skinny, so there isn't much room to move or use curlers, if you ever wanted to.
I like it but I like it but the other reviewers that said that it stops retracting were right. But it's powerful and I like that it folds in half. So now I just wrap the cord around it. But I wish it still retracted. :(
Just okay I know some other reviewers have raved about this hair dryer. For me, it's just okay. It gets the job done. I've got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They're sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn't do much for me. It works, and I'm keeping it. But I'm not sure I'd buy it again.
I don't get it This dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about, but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair, so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake.  That in itself is so frustrating that I can't see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great.
Elchim Hairdryer Hairdryer is heavier than I'm used to.  Controls are on handle and in the way.  Otherwise, it is just a hairdryer, no better or worse than others.  Could've spent less with same results.  Was disappointed after reading all the reviews.  Will keep it until it stops working.
Short weak arms look elsewhere, otherwise OK My other Conair 1875 was starting to turn itself off (shorting out?) during use so I hunted Amazon reviews for a good one with Prime shipping. This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap. Will update rating if it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).f it does not frizz my hair (anymore than I'm already drying it out by repeated washings).
Conair 225 The dryer is heavier than expected, and for the wattage, it puts out less air than it should.
The cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste - I prefer the lighter model Read the reviews and someone mentioned the cord is too short.  I agree.  It's doable but I have to watch that I don't turn around or move too far from the outlet.  Hair dryer is much heavier than my older model - I believe it's because of the reel inside the dryer for the cord.  The cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste - I prefer the lighter model.  My sister has the same one and after a while the button to reel the cord in broke.
works good but... I used this dryer maybe 10 times tops.<br />It burned out on me.<br />Purchased for the price. will get a bit more expensive one this time.<br />Happy with products sad that it didn't last
Too Heavy For Me, But Dries Well This hair dryer works well but it is larger and heavier than I expected and my hair seems to get caught in it a bit. I would have liked it better were it much lighter weight and smaller.
too heavy I had to work too hard to have this absorb and I don't think ou should have to do that with an eye cream. another cream for my hands until its done
Good ... and not so good Pros:   <br />1. This blow dryer is great for the price.  Just don't expect a $100+ ionic dryer.  You get a nice $18 dryer for $18 - simple. <br />2. Nice looking, sleek design, with retractable cord.  This is not a compact dryer for travel - it should be considered more of a mid-size. <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.  Retractable cord is quite short, which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by.   <br />2.  Very loud!  I saw others complain about this, and now I know what they mean.  It's loud.  <br />3.  The retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses.  This is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: <br />Does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky??  No more than any other dryer.  It's a nice, inexpensive, blow dryer, but I personally would not purchase it again. <br />
It does dry hair, but don't count on a retractable cord I've had this dryer about a year, and it does dry hair, and the heat settings seem to be what they say they are: hot, warm and cool. Also High and Low power are accurate. Unlike some other reviewers, I find that its drying power is fine -- but I have fine hair that dries really fast anyway. However, the retractable cord function has never worked well. The button does not seem to depress all the way, and IF it retracts all the way at all (not a guarantee most days), it's because I've had to keep pushing and pulling to engage the retracting mechanism, which is half-hearted at best. Most times I just give up halfway and wind the cord around the unit because it's too big a bother. I have NEVER experienced it retracting so fast that the cord whips around or anything; not anywhere near close to that problem for me!
Not bad dryer, especially when all they make are ionics I am super picky about my hair dryers.  And while this is not the best one I've ever had (my favorite was an 1875 watt Helen of Troy Professional that died several years ago), it's not bad.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, the only dryers I can seem to find are ionic ones.  For me ionic dryers = flat hair.  So, with the choices so limited, this dryer is decent.  I wish it had slow fan speed with high heat, but I can't be too choosy at this point.
Lasted but two years I have this dryer but it's currently mounted to my wall, unused, because it burned out after two years of mostly daily use. Still, I love the style and plan to get another one.
Three Stars The unit was cracked in serveral places when I received it, but all-in-all it worked fairly well.
 There is definitely potential to overheat.  At least that's what it smells like, so I don't use the hottest setting, but it is very quiet
Quiet, heavy, and a long barrel for shorter arms I was interested in the Conair Ion Shine hairdryer as a means to keep my hair healthier, plus, my older Conair dryer needed to be replaced. Since I have owned the Ion Shine (in the last 6 months) I've noticed that much more of my hair is breaking off near the scalp and I have a real problem with dryness and lack of body. (I haven't changed any other hair products.) The position of the ion switch is also a concern. I am a short lady so the weight of the dryer and the length of the barrel with the attachment is a problem as well. The dryer seems to run either too hot, or on warm is too cool to dry my fine hair in under 5-7 minutes. This is too long for me on work mornings.
Not for my hair. This hair dryer gave my hair great body but when it came to straightening it it fails. Its really only because I have insanely thick hair, this product would probably work on someone with thinner and more tamable hair than myself.
Other Reviews Correct About the Sparking I purchased this dryer a year ago and it has performed very well. I did go onto Amazon and  order the Babybliss tonight because this dryer has started sparking. When I am drying my hair I hear and see sparks. Crazy so I threw it away and researched reviews on several sites and ordered the Babybliss. I do not want to wait until this dryer burns my hair.
Outer coating flakes off This dryer works well, but the outer soft touch clear layer started to peel off after only about 4 weeks after purchasing it.  It's a shame since it looked so nice when it arrived and now it looks beat up and as if I've owned if for five years.  I've had other similar models by Conair in the past, but none ever did this.
gave 3 stars because it is advertised as having 2 ... gave 3 stars because it is advertised as having 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. It does but the heat settings are fixed to certain speeds. You cannot have high speed with low heat or low speed with high heat, only high heat with high speed or low heat with low speed etc. Wanted to control heat and speed separately. Nothing wrong with unit otherwise but lowered rating due to not being able to change heat and speed settings independently. Returned for refund.
Don't use the concentrator; it'll pull your hair out The John Frieda JF1 hair dryer is a lightweight hair dryer with a sleek design and ceramic heat technology.  Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn't a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It's also pretty loud.<br /><br />The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).<br /><br />Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn't an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.
dangerous because sucks in hair Broke right away.  Plastic end over filter screen popped off, dangerous because sucks in hair.
Not as Quiet as the Reviews said I was hoping for a quieter blow dryer. This is definitely quieter than my other dryer, but still not quiet. I also read all kinds of reviews that said this dries your hair so it's smooth and silky. The only thing that makes my hair smooth and silky is product!
Alright dryer I bought this dryer becuase I needed one quick and it was cheap. The different setting selection is nice. I have medium thick hair, and a lot of it, that comes down to between my shoulder blades and normally takes me about 30 minutes to dry. It did the job for about a year till it shorted out and sparks came out of it. Not a very long life, but I guess you get what you pay for. I have had other revlon hair styling tools that lasted longer, just not this one.
Pulls off the wall! how did this product get so many 5 star reviews?<br />The product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent. The product fails in my view because the three tiny 'Mollies' supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered. The dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times.<br />A better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws.<br />Another good product hijacked by under engineered Chinese Manufacture!
Nice dryer This is a nice hair dryer, but as hard as I've tried to figure out why it's a $130 hair dryer, I just can't find the value.<br /><br />I have pretty short hair and don't use a dryer that often, so I admit that I'm not the target market. But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more. Unfortunately, I wasn't wowed by this dryer.
Beware powerful stuff!! I ordered the product about two weeks ago. Shipping was fast, the product came in a plain box and was well packaged.  I have several skin tags on my neck and applied product carefully with a q-tip as directed. It has a stinging sensation on application so I was careful not to apply too much solution to the tags. I got some of the solution on the surrounding skin but applied the ointment to stop the burn. The solution burns the skin very quickly so you have to be carefuly not to apply too much. The burns has caused my skin to become discolored, my neck now looks worse than before and my tags haven't fallen off yet. That was a week ago, so I will now use a small brush to apply and hopefully this will prove a better applicator than the q-tip. I am now looking forward to be rid of the tags and acid burns on my neck.    If you are interested in purchasing this product, please proceed with caution. Maybe the suppliers could provide a small applicator with this purchase.
Limited life but awesome while it lasts I've had this dryer for 4 yrs. Best dryer I've  ever owned. Bit heavy but not unbearable. Problem is the finish degrades. It  now disgustingly sticky. If you know nars cosmetics compacts, that  how it gets. I'm tempted  to buy another one but looking for similar without that rubberized finish.
The attachment falls off very easily. Product came quickly but not sure I'd buy it again. The attachment falls off very easily.
Very good design, suspect reliability I travel fairly frequently, so hotels are a routine affair. I saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently. Its performance was impressive for its size. As soon as I got home I ordered one. I found the included mounting kit (screws, 3M tape, dry wall anchors) a little flimsy. I used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer.<br /><br />All was well for 3 days. The hair dryer worked like a champ, until the third day when the on/off switch blew up in my hands. The switch had shorted out, causing a large poof of smoke/fire. This of course happened just after I had tossed the original packaging and Amazon shipping box. So I contacted the manufacture about a replacement. They were VERY interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices ASAP. They sent out FedEx the next day to pick up the device to be sent back. I just received my replacement device, it took 15 days in total to receive it.<br /><br />I really hope this one lasts a bit longer.<br /><br />EDIT: I added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up.
I like the temperature settings of cool I like the temperature settings of cool, warm and hot but would like this dryer more if the flow of air were stronger when set on high.  It seems to take longer for my hair to dry with this dryer.
Didn't last We had this dryer for 1 year before it died.  Sadly, it was not heavily used - I usually air dry my long hair and my husband has short hair that takes all of 5 minutes to dry if that.  Initially it defaulted to just one speed.  Unfortunately that was high speed which was such a loud pitch, it hurt our ears to use it.  Not long after that it died altogether.  I'll try another wall mounted dryer, just not Andis.  Too bad they don't make hair dryers as well as they make the Andis clippers I've used for years as a dog groomer.
hair dryer I was very disappointed that the company would not honor the 4 year guarantee because I got this on Amazon.  They said it was not a qualified seller.  Amazon should also tell buyers that if you purchase this item on Amazon, the company will not honor the 4 year warranty.
Worked fine but didn't last long I bought this hari dryer about 2.5 years ago. I liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light. It was never the most powerful hairdryer but I generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls, so I wasn't that worried about it. If I was pulling and straightening my hair every day, this would not have been enough power. That said, it worked fine for what I needed. However, today it started to spark. This is not hard wired, its just a plug in model. I was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out. I would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this. Too bad.     Considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product, I would not buy it again.
I do wish the High/Off/Low switch were more like a High/Low/Off switch since I accidentally push it too ... Does what it says on the tin! A simple, inexpensive hairdryer. I do wish the &#34;High/Off/Low&#34; switch were more like a &#34;High/Low/Off&#34; switch since I accidentally push it too far every time I use it. But it was a minor concern and it's not as if I'll accidentally leave it on. Just a minor inconvenience.
The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  I bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter's favorite color, but when it arrived, it was very pink, which was disappointing.  It should have had a better description in the specs.
This item has a few problems --- The item is described as a soft bonnet hair dryer.  The dryer works, but the bonnet is not at all soft.  It occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet.  The temperatures can get too hot; low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting. Watch out!
OK dryer This is not as good as the hair dryer I use at home, a Conair 225NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875-Watt Hair Dryer. For compact, portable, it is not that small. For use as a regular hair dryer, it takes awhile to dry, and just hi/lo heat and volume. My previous portable one was smaller and dried better. This works OK.
Edit, no where near the V2 Volare by Babybliss EDIT:<br />Turned my hair into straw<br /><br />original review:<br /><br />Pros: good blow, not too hot<br />Cons:heavy and the way the attachments attach is bad (you really have to push super hard)<br /><br />Best under $100 hairdryer I have ever used. I had a 20% of coupon at that big bed and bath store. It was 99.99 so I got a good deal. It is a solid hair dryer and solid made. Made in Italy. Good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage. With good technique can leave hair silky soft. Not as defrizzing as my Volare though. And it feels heavier to me. So my Volare will remain my baby. It is better than the Elchim 2001, the $300 T3,  $200 CHI and an FHI dryer that I tried. I have super long wavy hair, live in the Bay Area, and I don't get haircuts often enough, so I need the anti-frizz. Also I am not great at blowdrying hair so I need the idiot proof anti-frizzer.<br /><br />It is not as good as my Volare V2 by Babyliss with the Ferrari AC motor (paid $70 more for). That dryer is magic. That and the Italiabrava by Babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market!
nice while it lasted My experience with this hairdryer is nearly identical to that of a previous reviewer. It's easy to install, and handy as all get out. However, almost on its one-year birthday, the low setting stopped working, and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard. The handgrip started heating up as I held it, and when I tried to turn it off, the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more. Since it had taken on a life of its own, I had to unplug the unit and un-install the whole thing. This is a great concept for a hairdryer--it can't be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use. Granted, an appliance that retails for less than $30 can be expected to not last forever, but I've owned hand-held hairdryers that wouldn't quit for years and years. I'm disappointed--my first thought was to purchase another just like it, but since this appears to be a problem for others as well, I'll look for another solution.
Okay performance - better than average equipment longevity Unlike many other reviewers here, I have exceptionally thin hair.  I purchased this dryer with the intent to improve the condition.  It does a FAIR job. I have had the dryer about 2 years and it hold up rather well considering the abuse I give it.  The dryer has very little power and I would say that drying time probably takes about 2-3 minutes longer than with a regular blow dryer.  If you have very frizzy or curly hair then you I probably would NOT recommend this just based on the power levels.  If you have wavy hair then this dryer in combination with either a diffuser or the accompanying attachment should would well for you.  It is a heavier hair dryer and isn't great to take on vacations.  The position of the ion switch is lousy - you'll probably find yourself accidentally turning it off just based on it's location.  Settings are either high or low and the same goes for speed.  I happen to use high but if you like variety you may want to consider another model.  A better buy is the Revlon Ion dryer if you feel like upgrading.  The difference in price is perhaps 5 U.S. dollars at best....
Conflicted The motor whines slightly & the &#34;coating&#34; on the body is flaking.  I do like the heat it can put out. I like the rubber &#34;bumper&#34; spots they have around. Cord is just long enough for me but I also knew length before ordering.
Powerful hair dryer (dries thick hair fast) but smells like car engine Not sure whether all &#34;professional&#34; quality hair dryers smell like fumes, but this one does. Other than that, it works fine so far.
Wall mount hair dryer saves space I ordered this one to replace the broken one,<br />I installed this product mainly to save the space,<br />but it is not durable, the spring latch and circuit<br />in the old one broken, it should last longer.<br />But overall, this product saves space.
Great features, but a couple issues Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the essential requirements that I look for in a hair dryer.  I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

Heavier than I would like for travel. This a good hairdryer. I use it as my everyday dryer. It is a bit heavy for packing if weight is an issue.
Not what I expected. There are not 3 levels of heat. There ARE 3 levels of blowing air, but I wish the heat was different. Not what I expected. I do like the retractable cord for the convenience of storage. I've used the dryer for about 3 weeks.
Not to hot not to cold It does not get hot, but that's better of hair anyway.
it's ok... Had this for about two years and the bearings have already started to fail. Makes more noise than when new. It's ok... but not great.
Liked it at first but it didn't have a long life, sadly!! It didn't last long. Suddenly died with no warning after no abuse and minimal use. Disappointed - Planned obsolescence!!  Things dont last very long anymore. Aren't made or built to last like years back!!
Three Stars Works as expected, but the Scotch sticky mounts don't hold up against steam...
Andis is a brand that lasts I bought an Andis wall mount dryer 25 years ago and used it every day without problems so I decided to get this model as a replacement when the old one finally gave out.  I'm hoping that it will give me the same great service.  The unit is larger than my original more compact version, but it does work well.  the reason that i'm giving this product a 3 is because it's more cumbersome, the slide switch on the handle is difficult to operate, (it doesn't slide easily) and there is a very bright night light built into it which I was aware of, but was surprised by the level of brightness it emits. It's too bright since my bathroom is part of the master suite without a door on it. I had to put duct tape over the light to try to block it out. This dimmed it about 50%. Obviously I'd much rather not have the light, or at least have an option to turn it off.
Hair Dryer/Review This hairdryer is overpriced for the value.  I dropped it and pieces went flying.  I was able to put it back together but had to snap parts back in place.  Not worth the money, wish I would have got a less expensive hair dryer.  All hair dryers blow hot air, this one blows hot air for a large price tag.  Not impressed.  Would not recommend this product to a friend.
It's okay. It works, but the switch is really cheesy.
It's just OK I would really like the hose to be longer.  If you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet.  You also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor.  The dryer on hot gets way too hot.  Even on medium it gets very hot.  I've wound up using it on the cool setting.  One good thing- the bonnet really is a nice big one.
Low speed not hot enough I love everything about this dryer EXCEPT the low speed while on hot is NOT hot enough. It feels like it's blowing cool air.
Interesting and functional design, questionable extra features, and a high price As usual I have my wife test out the hair dryers as she is the one with the hair...<br /><br />I think the design is beautiful. She thinks the dryer is ugly. She said it's a high quality dryer, but overall she prefers our John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer (which costs something like 75% less than this model).<br /><br />My wife has thin hair which is easily damaged. She sees absolutely not difference with the &#34;Nanoe Technology&#34;. The ionizing and &#34;moisture-rich nanoe particles&#34; were dismissed by her as a marketing ploy. I'm not sure about that but will say that at the very least mileage will vary.<br /><br />My wife DOES like the power, and the separate speed and temperature controls.<br /><br />My conclusion? If you have the money and like the design it's a well-built and very functional dryer. If you just want a good reliable dryer you can find good ones for far cheaper.
Three Stars the bonnet is not big enought for big roller
Disappointed This was the first time I spent  more than $40 for a hair dryer, so I was expecting it to be great. But after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off. However the dryer works well, it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair. I should have returned it. Too much money for an okay hair dryer!
Satisfied In spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what I need it to do. I'm an African American Natural & I purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments. I only gave this a 3 because it's not mobile & it's so huge to store.. Other wise it heats just fine, also because I would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it'd take a great deal of time but I don't use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments. But it adjusts just fine & I'm comfortable under it. You do need to be a bit creative about where to put it I suppose. I sit on the toilet w/it perched on my portable drawers I use for storage. I guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that I'm pleased for my intended purposes.
my bad... None available.
Not for thick hair I returned mine. I got it to take with me to the gym to dry my hair after a sweaty workout and it was not powerful enough for my thick hair. I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one but still, it was useless for me.
Heavy and has a weak drying power Not thrilled about this one. It's cheap and it shows. Heavy to hold and dries the hair on the slower side. It doesn't have that hurricane effect as some other cheaper model. I wouldn't recommend it.
Mounting plate machine screws were too short to engage the plate. Luckily the hardware has these 2mm x 20 mm screws I needed. Blower volume is lower than I wanted and/or  expected. This is not a low line dryer for Andies. Will dry my hair, but will take longer than I wanted it to, so it did not meet my expectations.
Ok! This blow dryer throws a lot of air, however the air is not necessarily hot enough to dry your hair fast or smooth. Takes a long time to dry my hair and it does it a little frizzy compared to my previous blower which I had to throw Away because the cable began to get hot. But it's a good blower for the price I paid!
Worked well until it died After my old hair dryer died, I decided to get this one because my mom has it. I had it for only two or three months before it started to make rattling noises when I used it. I would hit it, and the rattling would lessen. However, after a short while of this happening, I was drying my hair and it started to smell smoky. I decided to give up on it before it caught fire or something.<br />If my mom didn't have the same one that has been working perfectly fine for over a year, I would have rated this one star.
Does a good job... ... of blow-styling, but it is a bit heavy. You wouldn't want to travel with it, and if you had a big, long, full head of hair that took awhile to dry, your arm would get mighty tired.
eehhh The powers is not as great as previous dryers I have owned. I bought it because it was pink & pretty. Wish I hadn't now.
Three Stars I hope it last long than the one I got last year
Record time drying. Size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord.
Fairly decent but causes some frustration This hair dryer is one of the fastest drying hair dryers I've ever used. It also looks sleek and professional. I like that it comes with multiple attachments to give you the best blow dry you can get.<br /><br />I only have a few issues with this particular hair dryer. It blows really hard. Even on the slowest setting, the air blows out very forcefully. If I need precision drying, I have to use the diffuser attachment, otherwise my hair gets blown to smithereens. Another problem is the rocker switch design. When I'm using this, the rocker switch controls on the handle are very easy to push and I'm regularly having to reset my settings. After I while this gets very annoying.<br /><br />It seems to be lasting me pretty well. I've been using it almost one year and haven't had any trouble with its performance. I hope it lasts me a few more years.<br /><br />Overall, this hair dryer is usable but might cause some frustration.
Not as great as I was expecting I bought this because I was looking for a faster drying, and more quiet hair dryer.  My husband always complains about me blow drying my hair in the mornings before he gets up. In all honesty, I can't tell the difference between this one, and my previous $10 Revlon one from Walmart. It takes the same amount of time to dry my hair, and to me, it doesn't seem any quieter.  I do like the IDEA of the Ions leaving your hair less staticy and healthier, but I don't know that I can really tell the difference. My husband hasn't been complaining about the noise as much, but I don't know if its because he knows I bought a new hair dryer trying to please him, or if it's actually a lower frequency. To me, with it up close to my head, I can't tell a difference.
Not worth the price I like the nozzle attachment, but it can fall off easily which can get annoying.  It has 2 levels of heat settings and 2 levels of cool blow dry settings so that is good, and it is not heavy.  But I recently used a friend's Conair Infinity hairdryer and I actually liked that much better, it dried my hair in less time and it was less frizzy....
Loud hairdryer I placed this on my wishlist and it was purchased for me for Christmas.  I love the color and the cord keeper, however it is very very loud on any setting.
Its compact!!! Great compact design. I love the cord hanger. The light is pretty bright, but exactly as advertised. It does take longer to dry my hair-but it is doing less damage....
Not Good for Fine Hair Having baby fine hair and not a lot of it, I find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month.  There are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings, the 1st heat setting being cool. The 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair. The highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head. The switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle. I don't think this dryer is worth its higher price.
Not as powerful as others led me to believe. Not as powerful as others led me to believe. However, it is cute and very easy to travel with. It will be a staple in my suitcase from now on.
No difference I tend to have frizzy hair.  I honestly haven't noticed a difference between this hair dryer or any old regular hair dryer making my hair less frizzy.  I ordered this one because my old one broke.  I'm not noticing any difference.
Good hair dryer. Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16. Blows hot and cold.
Ok but could be stronger I thought it would be stronger. I even leave turbo option on all of the time, but my older, cheaper hairdryer definitely dried quicker. I do like the attachments though (diffuser, concentrator). It is heavier like I have read before buying, and the cord must be shorter because it gets pulled out of the wall by accicent at least once with every use. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.
I'll keep it - at least for now Thie texture on this dryer feels nice, but it's much heavier than my last one. It hasn't gotten &#34;sticky&#34; as some have noted, but I've only used it for a few weeks. It comes with a tiny diffuser, which was good, because my diffuser doesn't fit it. I wish I could get a larger one, but I'll have to look at an after market one - I'll probably have to take the dryer with me to make sure it will stay on. The dryer is pretty quiet and powerful, which is nice.<br /><br />One of the things I would change is the location of the buttons. I never fail to change the speed or heat when I'm using it. I use a stronger grip on it due to the weight, so it's easier for me to hit a button on accident.<br /><br />I wouldn't &#34;not&#34; recommend it, but I would suggest to keep looking a little bit more.
It's hot! Two settings: low hot or high hot. It's really featherweight. Quick drying time but the motor doesn't sound as good as my old Italian made dryer. I wish I had tested it out in person first before buying I would return it but I got it for a song and don't want to pay the shipping cost and 15% restocking fee. It'll do.
Not strong enough This hair dryer was too heavy, and, although it claims 1875 watt, it was neither as strong or hot as the ION I had been using
oh After received, I was shocked.<br />Very heavy.<br />Thanks to the wind. Soon blow dry my hair.<br />But I don't have to buy and try other brands of products in the United States.
Hair Dryer A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain.  I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first.  Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall.  The cord stays out of the sink, too!
Three Stars Underpowered.
Gave to Granddaughter When my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke!  Doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head!
It's ok Nothing to get excited about. It works well and I like the cool temperature setting.  The cord is much shorter than the hair dryer I had to replace.
Three Stars Quite noisy compared to others we have had. Retraction cord has to be jiggled in order to retract.
Blo and Go woe The concept was good.  I like the idea of hands free drying.  But... The engineering was bad.  Dispite the large suction cup it still fell off of my mirror.  So I stuck it to the sink.  It fell over and the dryer hit the 6 foot mirror over my sink.  Thought it was a gonner but turned out ok.  I still stick it on the sink but position it so that if it falls it will not damage anything in its path.  Maybe if I could attach it permanently to the wall!!!
Defuser doesn't stay on I love this dryer but have gone through two in the last year. I always use the defuser with it and the defuser attachment ALWAYS falls off (about 30 times during a blow dry). This dryer works well on frizz when the defuser is staying on, but it is extremely frustrating to constantly stop and reattach it.
adequate Had the features I wanted like cool shot and retractable cord. The dimensions are accurate, but unfortunately, it's just a lot bigger and heavier than I expected. Additionally, the folding mechanism and the materials feel pretty cheap, and I'm not certain how long this hairdryer will actually last.
Three Stars Kind of weak
It's ok.... My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily. I have natural textured African American hair. When I blow dry my hair I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector. I think the dryer is great for the price but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do. When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....ugh!
This dryer is just ok ... While it is extremely lightweight and the long cord is great, I've had better dryers and regret this purchase. I agree that this dryer is effective in cutting down the time it takes to dry thick hair; it does not, however, have enough heat to straighten and smooth my thick yet fine textured wavy hair without using a flat iron. It leaves my hair straight, but a little on the frizzy/ bushy side in comparison to other dryers i've owned in the past. I hate the way my hair looks when i use it alone and now need to spend more money on something better.
DRYS WELL IT'S GOOD BUT VERY VERY HEAVY AND HARD TO HOLD.  DOES A GOOD JOB BUT IS DIFFICULT TO HANG ON TO
Just okay.... doesnt seem to have ... Just okay....doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power, and the on/off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it. The filter door keeps popping open too....I kept it, but not all that thrilled with it.
Was fantastic, died within a year. I absolutely loved this dryer! It dried my thick, heavy hair so fast! Also, the cord was fantastically long! Would be 5 stars, but I bought it last April, and sadly it has already died on me. There seems to be a short in the cord. If I wiggle the cord around at the base of the dryer, I can still get it to work a little. Tempted to buy another, since the price is so reasonable.
Three Stars Nothing too special here.  Okay hair dryer.
Executive the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing.  No registration information and no product information was included.  Maybe shouln't have ordered it around Xmas time.
Three Stars Wife likes it but it looks a bit cheap
Not impressed I'm a little disappointed, Andis.<br /><br />I bought this dryer for trips, and it does what it needs to do - it folds up, it dries my hair. But it's rather loud, and the cord isn't entirely retractable, and it's frankly a little underpowered - it's slow. Is it fine for trips? Yes. But I've used much better, stronger dryers that cost far less. Be aware: You're paying for the label, not the performance. (&#34;Ceramic&#34; - oh lord, that is truly up there with &#34;ionic&#34; in the pantheon of absurd &#34;just paint it on there and add another zero to the price&#34; labels!) I don't hate it, but I wouldn't buy it again.
Meh. Nothing extraordinary. This dryer is &#34;ok&#34; I was hoping for something a little more powerful than what I already had. It gets the job done but no quicker than my other blow dryer...in fact I feel like it takes my hair a bit longer to try.  And it is HEAVY. After reading the great reviews, I guess I was hoping for something more than it actually was--which is a regular &#34;ok&#34; hair dryer.
I really wanted more speeds as it turns out. ... I really wanted more speeds as it turns out. Not very powerful. I gave it to my husband who doesn't have much hair.
Does the job Shipment is on time just like how it is described.<br />Dryer is little heavy for use, I like compact once.
Three Stars Need to be very specific on hanging cord or inside wiring.
Still  looking I am disappointed tha it is so large; not what I envisioned for a travel dryer. Certainly NOT Mini! Works ok at home.
I like the hair dryer it dries my hair pretty quickly ... I like the hair dryer it dries my hair pretty quickly but never burns. The concentrator works well which is very important to me as this attachment is the key to straight and smooth hair. The only negative is the placement of the control buttons. The on/off button and temperate button are in opposite order of all my previous hair dryers so it takes getting use to.
Three Stars Would have preferred a stronger airflow
Three Stars does the job
My Least Favorite of Crest's Whitestrips I have used several kinds of Crest Whitestrips, from the original to the pro to the advanced and other varieties.  I love them, even the original strips work great.  These 5 minute strips, however, I was not impressed with and found them to be pretty much ineffective.  My advice to those with sensitive teeth:  rather than buying these strips, buy the originals or an upgraded version and use them less often than as directed to reduce sensitivity.  Use them once every few days or once a week rather than the recommended once or twice a day.  You will still get great results, but giving your teeth a break in between uses will dramatically decrease any pain from sensitivity.
Three Stars It works wery well but it is covered by a kind of rubber that glues dust and loose hair.
Be Aware It has no heat selection, only settings of high or low for air flow.  High almost burns my scalp.  Low works but is slower.  Must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting.
Retractable Cord I Love the retractable cord feature, except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase.  I guess I will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord :(
pretty quiet for the This is really heavy, pretty quiet for the size
Limited Settings & Only Lasted a Year. Update...The hair dryer slowly died after one year of use. Not surprising since it only had two settings: kinda powerful and very powerful. It was good for quickly drying my hair, but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling. I mostly used it when traveling. I was also never happy with the plastic wall mount because it cracked and the hair dryer sometimes falls out.
Good blow dryer but didn't last After doing some research, I decided to go with this blow dryer because it had all the features I wanted and I was able to get it at a reasonable price. I've had this dryer for just over a year and up until today, I only had one minor issue with it: the cord would not always reel in all the way when I pushed the button.<br /><br />Well, sadly, today it decided to die on me. I plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound, shut off and caused the outlet to smoke. I tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough, it will not longer turn on. I did use it pretty much every day so it had heavy use but I expect a blow dryer to last at least several years.
Ok This hairdryer is ok.  I like some aspects of it such as being able to adjust the heat and air level, but I don't think that this dries my hair any faster than the other cheaper hair dryer that I have.  I also feel the weight on my arms that other reviewers were discussing.  I am not sure that it has had any effect on the level of shine or frizz in my hair although being able to adjust the level of heat and air has probably helped in terms of being able to prevent heat damage.  I think it is an ok hair dryer but I would not buy it again. I did not return it mostly because of the hassle of repackaging and sending it back.
The dryer arrived in good condition due to being carefully wrapped The dryer arrived in good condition due to being carefully wrapped.  It was exactly as described.  The only thing I found that was<br />a slight  negative is that it is heavier than I expected.
Not as quiet as I wanted This was a fine dryer, but I returned it. It simply wasn't as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers. The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings. That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it's much quieter than other dryers I tried.
definitely lightest dryer I ever used This dryer is by far the lightest I have used. It does the job but DOES NOT dry hair any faster than my chi. It actually takes longer but I do notice a little less frizz. If you are looking for less stress on your arm and neck I recommend trying this.
Wish it would have lasted I liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons. The retractable cord is nice, but I had to struggle with it numerous times. Unfortunately my unit stopped working after about 15 months after purchasing.
It's ok I did a search for &#34;quiet dryers&#34; and this came up.  The reviews sounded ok so I went for it.  It's considerably heavier than the old one I had and definitely stronger.  Overall, it feels like a solid build and does its job with the only complaint being that it's a bit heavier for some (perhaps).  I'd recommend it but have only been using it for 2 weeks.
Nice product low noise The dryer is very quiet, gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed, but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers, but I am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site.
For a Quiet Dryer, It's Just Okay There are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer, which I think is fine, but I wanted to comment on it being a quiet dryer.  It is quieter than most, but my previous Conair Ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high, and this one is 90 decibels on high.  Anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing, so I'm a bit disappointed in this, but again, it's still quieter than most hair dryers... but I would have thought the newer dryer would have been even more quiet.
Hair Dryer Great hair dryer. It gets the job done really fast however the only qualm I have is that the cord is only three foot long.
Okay, it does work, but there are better products out there Lasted about a year.  I'm back to Remington, I used Remington hair dryers for years and they last the longest.  Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.
Plug is too big. You know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets. Hangs down too much and hits the counter tops.  Good power though
Smaller than expected and not silver but grey I wanted an inexpensive hair dryer for my trip to Florida. Back home I have a lightweight ion shine dryer.  I was disappointed that the dryer didn't look exactly as the picture. It's a little bit smaller and the silver on the sides and bottom are actually grey.   I choose this hair dryer primarily because of the price and the looks.When it arrived it was smaller and heavier than expected but overall it accomplished the job. Let's say it works nicely.   If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, go ahead and buy it.
good dood
No cool shot I bought this keeping in mind that the cool shot button may not work after reading a review. I blow dry my hair at most 3 times for the year so for me it does the job. I use the cool setting which still feels a little warm to me but it helps to stretch my hair very well but without the heat damage (I still use heat protectant though). But.. the cool shot button DEFINITELY DOESN'T WORK
Not what I was looking for I have a conair Mini from years ago fits in the palm of my hand .. this one is almost regular size.. I was looking for a very small hair dryer for trips.
Philips Norelco Bodygroom Summery: This product is great when used for intended purpose, however its cheap construction means it has a limited life span.    PROS:   *** It is gentle and easy to use on very hard to reach places.     CONS:   *** After about 2 years of use the button broke, stuck in the depressed position, meaning I can no longer turn the thing on.   *** Its great for soft body hair, not great for anything above the neck.     REVIEW: Initially this seemed like a great purchase, it shaves reasonably close but at no danger of nicking the skin no matter what awkward angle you use. It seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean. No one wants details as to where and how this product was used, but I will say if you're hoping for a multitasking razor this isn't it. I would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when I had one, and it worked okay, but sometimes snag the larger hairs, needed multiple passes, etc. This isn't a big deal, I think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub-par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both.     What really lost stars was the product's history of breaking through no fault of the user. Unfortunately, even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it WILL end up breaking. Now I know nothing last forever, but I think for an electronics device that costs $40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week, it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years.     Sadly Norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well, so I replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer. I don't feel good, though, about endorsing Norelco with a repeat purchase.
Does the job This dryer is a bit larger than I expected but is very lightweight. I have a couple minor issues : there is no 'loop' attached to hang up the dryer and the cord is about a foot too short for my taste. It DOES dry my hair however, so all in all, it does the job.
It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor It's an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor. The airflow is weak even on the highest setting. It says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one. Also it is quite bulky. It does reduce frizz and improve the shine.<br /><br />I recommend it to a person with short and fine hair. If you have coarse or curly hair, I wouldn't pick this one.
but otherwise a good machine. Just with the bonnet was easier to fit over rollers. but otherwise a good machine.
Needs Stiffer Brush The genuine boars bristle brush is too soft and will not turn or lift my hair. The bristles just squish out and do not stay stiff enough to work hair. I think the boars bristles would be even worse with thick hair. They need a stiff nylon brush option.  They also need a medium speed for drying. You get slow low and fast high and if you can hold your finger on the quick heat button then maybe you can get to medium heat and blowing speed from the low setting but you can't hold the button for long. There should be some sort of trigger with the quick heat button built in or a way to lock it down. I don't use the other two attachments. I'd swap them for two different brushes or one good stiff brush attachment.
Mirror is REALL SMALL for the price but is actually FOGLESS I just got the mirror today, opened the box and to my surprise was a tiny little mirror. No where on Amazon did it say the mirror was actually only 6in x 5in, especially given the price. However the mirror does what it says and is fogless which is nice. The first time I used it I put water in the back and put it on the suction cups and within a minute it fell onto my toe. So i tried cleaning the area behind the suction cups with some soap and that helped and it didn't fall the second time. Given the price I would expect the mirror to be larger, but on the positive it is actually fogless.
Decent dryer Good price on this dryer with the excellent option of a built in cord reel.  We will see how long that holds up.  Couple of issues I disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy, wish it was a bit quieter, and also doesn't seem like the air blows very hot.  Seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model.
Noisy. Noisy. I don't see anything professional about this dryer.
favorite hairdryer, but doesn't last This hairdryer is quieter than most and works great. I owned three, but that was the problem. I purchased it three times because I loved it so much. However, each hairdryer lasted less than a year, and I used it probably four times per week. I was very disappointed in what seemed to be a great hairdryer of poor quality in that was unable to last. Sad to have to switch to something more reliable!
Not the usual hotel hair dryer I ordered the Andis based on the two speeds, cord holder, and   night light.   After installing, I wanted the higher 1600 W and you need a screwdriver to change the speeds. This is very inconvenient. After finishing the change and using, the cord stretched out and didn't return to it's compact size,leading me to think that's why they may have put the little knob on the side.  The night light is a nice feature.   I am disappointed with the look of the stretched out cord.  I will, leave the dryer on the high speed as it makes no sense  to keep changing the intensity.  Yes, it's quiet. Priced reasonably.
barely satisfied It does not heat as well as I think it should, barely adequate and would not purchase again.
Works for small jobs This hair dryer is just alright. I have fine wavy hair, but a lot of it, and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser. After looking through reviews I decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same Vidal Sassoon model I've owned for many years.<br />My first impression was that I was shocked by how heavy it was, because it's ceramic. It can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it. Secondly, the difference between the &#34;warm&#34; to the &#34;hot&#34; setting is pretty big. The &#34;warm&#34; on mine has barely more heat than the &#34;cool&#34; setting and the &#34;hot&#34; setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two. The &#34;hot&#34; also makes my hair super frizzy, but that's fixed by blasting it on the &#34;cool&#34; setting after the heat. But I do worry that it damages my hair. I would use the &#34;warm&#34; setting if it didn't take so long.<br />This hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend's and I only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift, so it doesn't see much use. Because I don't use it often I can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me. If I had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair I would return it.
Not the same as the travel model We purchased the black travel model while we were traveling because our old Conair went on the blink. Had to get it from Target. It works great - pleased with the feel, dual voltage for travel, etc. Like the button that allows you to control the cooling on the high fan setting. Powerful blower in that little motor. However, after we ordered what we thought was the same through Amazon, it turned out that the color is not the only thing different on this unit from the black one by Conair. This unit is louder and feels cheeper. I recommend the black unit that looks identical to this one except that the cooling button is on the back side of the unit. The only number I could find on the black unit was D167S - that may be an older version of the Conair &#34;Folding Handle&#34; dryer on the Conair website - Model: 124TL. It's available at Amazon for only $13.65 at the time of this review.
Save your money I purchased it hoping to get that salon blowout look. I was disappointed when it worked the exact same a my old $15 dollar hair dryer.
good but can't take the scent I feel bad not giving this a great review.  I love how safe it is and it seems to work well.  It's also not that expensive as far as mineral sunscreens go.  I just hate the scent though.  I put it on my son, but use a different brand for myself.  I'm probably a bit more sensitive to scents than most, but I'm happier with California Baby, other than the price.  I haven't tried the unscented Badger though, and probably should.
Doesn't dry as quickly as I'd hoped, but decent dryer, especially for the price.  Not too loud compared with what I'm used to. OK hair dryer.  I like the non-skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn't slip off bathroom shelf.  The overall drying could be improved.  My Vidal Sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster.  I'm going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath.
which normally is a good feature. Had wanted a dryer to possibly do ... It doesn't get too warm, though it does include a button to push to stop the heating element from heating for a while, which normally is a good feature.<br /><br />Had wanted a dryer to possibly do light duty as a heat gun too, but this model will get no where close to doing that.  Though, it does dry my hair eventually, just wish the output was better than slightly warm.
Ok I really need one of these that goes from 1/4-1 inch barrel as I have very short layered hair I need to and volume and height to and turn curlers to soft waves.  I do not want it straight.
Three Stars Happy female family with this.
Good dryer but short cord I have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great, has great power and is hot enough.  I have medium length & thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes.  My only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so I have to plug it into an adapter I have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug.  Also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way.  Sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so I have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way.  When it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel.  Overall its been a good dryer though and am glad I have it and it was a good price.
New replacement heads make noise! I've been using the Sonicare for many, many years, probably 15 years, when they first came out.  I have the Advance handle and Philips no longer makes replacement heads for the Advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e-series that is supposed to fit the Advance handle.  I ordered the three pack of the e-series and it does fit the original Advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use.  Apparently, the magnets on the e-series' don't match what was originally designed for the Advance handles.  I called Philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise.  It's not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads.  The technician did not know about the difference in noise, checked with others and then got back to me that, yes, there is a difference in noise.  Philips should tell the user about this difference.  It's no big deal, but should be disclosed.<br /><br />What I found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months.  The old packaging said every 6 months.  When I asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the American corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more, she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals.  Whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy, I do not know.  Whether the new heads are not as well built as the old, I also don't know.  But in any event, since I've been using the Sonicare for the past 15 years or so I've changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and I've had no complaints from my dentist.  I guess I'll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because I didn't change the replacement head after three months.<br /><br />But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.  The e-series does fit, albeit not perfectly.<br /><br />Stay tuned.e replacement head after three months.    But to Philips credit, at least they didn't simply stop making a head to fit the Advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads.  The e-series does fit, albeit not perfectly.    Stay tuned.
HELLO KITTY HAIR DRYER gave them to my granddaughters for Easter  they use only HELLO KITTY hairdryers in college
not what I expected to large than was pictured.After I ordered this one I found a smaller one ,the 124 AR Vagabond and it meets what I needed
The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn't seem ... The retractable cord rarely fully retracts and it doesn't seem to get as hot as other hair dryers I have had in the past
Fair to Midway A little noisy, not like my previous pro dryer, but it drys my hair. The little air diffuser doesn't stay on which really burns me as I have to keep picking up and putting on.....there's nothing to keep it connected. Dumb construction.
Don't buy it for the cord retraction feature. If you are purchasing this dryer solely for the cord retraction feature, you will be very disappointed.  Very seldom does the last 10-12 inches retract into the handle.
Powerful Very nice hairdryer. It is a little heavy, but you get used to it after a while. Gives a lot of power, so your hair dries quickly. Concentrator is included, so it helps prevent frizz. My hair does get a little frizzy after this, but it is not as bad as with other hair dryers. There are 3 settings and a Cool Shot button.
Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer I really liked the cord retractor and the ability to fold the handle for storage.  It also worked very well to dry hair.  However, it did not last nearly as long as it should have - only a few months before the cord stopping retracting and less than a year before it burnt up.
Ceramic Blow Dryer Not nearly as good as the other Andis with the retractable cord and it is double the price. Don't waste your money.
Pro Beauty Hair Dryer It's ok.  I was disappointed in how big it turned out to be.  I was hoping it would be closer to a travel size.  The diffuser is too big for me....but I decided to keep it regardless.
nice but slow It is a nice unit. Compact and easy to use but it takes a long time to dry my hair.
No Pro in this model For drying hair it does work very well and does not give off ozone, which is good if you have asthma or other respiratory sensitivities. Believe it or not, but another ionizing hair dryer caused my eyes to water and wheezing. I could barely sleep until my girlfriend happened across some information that said the ionizing hair dryers can cause this. When she purchased this hair dryer my asthma problems stopped. Unfortunately, I have to knock several stars off this product because the on/off switch has already failed, which was pretty disappointing.
Wish it had more power I have very long thick hair that is mid-way down my back.  My old hair dryer last several years but finally died.  I decided on this one because of the reviews and the color (I admit it.)<br /><br />The color is beautiful.  It is the most 'pretty' hair dryer that I have ever owned.<br /><br />The retractable cord is a must for me.  This is an awesome feature that I will not go without.  It makes it possible for easier storage and you don't have to worry about the cord getting tangled, ripped, etc.<br /><br />The heating settings are very standard and work very well.<br /><br />**The only issue for me is the power (or lack thereof.)<br />The highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer.  (My old dryer had the same amount of watts as this one.)  Due to this, it takes much more time to dry my hair than I am used to.  However, if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you.
But I like, that it has a cold setting Take's forever to dry my hair. Which is median length. But I like, that it has a cold setting. And you don't have to hold a button, down. Which I really like. All, and all, for what I paid for it, it's okay.
Missing an attachment The hair dryer came to me without the brush attachment. I tried to obtain the brush even if I had<br />to pay for it. The seller was  not  helpful at all in me getting the attachment.
Some pluses, some minuses This is my only experience with an ionic hair dryer, so I have nothing with which to compare this one.  However, I bought it because I had several expections about its features.  Here is how each feature measured up:<br />Quicker?  NO.  It may even take a little longer than a standard 1875-watt dryer.  The reason is that the fan does not blow very hard.  The high setting blows about like the low setting on a standard dryer.<br />Reduced frizz/flyaways/static? YES.  These are significantly reduced.<br />Increased shine?  YES.  My hair is visibly shinier.<br />Quieter?  YES, but qualified.  The only reason it is quieter is because it doesn't blow air as hard as a regular dryer.<br />Freshens hair?  YES.  <br />Another drawback:  This dryer is very heavy.  It took me several days to get used to how heavy it is.<br />This dryer delivers almost all of what ionic hairdryers promise, but I was mostly hoping for a dryer to speed drying time.  If you have thin hair or hair that dries quickly or have plenty of time to dry your hair, then I would highly recommend this dryer.  My hair looks shinier and healthier.
Hoped for better I got this hoping it would be a good replacement for my last blow dryer that i loved, and had for 3 years. I like the bendable handle and retractable cord. the setting are nice BUT it randomly shuts off while im using it!!! Ill have it on medium heat on high and its like it over heats or something. Its horrible for when im in a hurry getting ready for work because it takes at least 10 minutes to cool down enough for it to turn back on. And its not the outlet, or the fuse, i can take it to every outlet in my house and it still wont work until it cools down. But for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected any better.
Lasted only 15 months to the day I expect to get more than 15 months out of a hairdryer, especially since I travelled for work about 30% of the time and didn't bring this hairdryer with me.  This hairdryer replaced the Blackbird, which lasted over 3 years.  I liked that this dryer was powerful and hot.  It dried my hair quickly, and I had no problems blowing my very wavy hair out straight.  I'd love to get another one, but am trying a BaByliss this time in the hopes that it will last longer.
More Pros than Cons It's too bad we can't try hair dryers out in the store before purchasing because there is so much to consider when buying one  - air flow, heat, weight, noise level, how the attachments fit, etc.-  and hair dryers that have 5-star reviews still tend to have 1-star reviews as well.  How confusing!  I finally decided upon the Argan Heat because no one on Amazon rated it below 3 stars.  This was the first time I ever bought a hair dryer over $30.00.  Using the Argan Heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry, fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair. Now my hair dries quickly, feels silky and looks healthy.  My complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm,  the low-speed setting blows too hard, and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw/push on (it does not slide on as the box says).  I am not bothered by the weight, and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant, quiet whoosh, but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned.  I may end up exchanging this hair dryer before the return date expires in case there's a problem.
hair dryer this is kind of bulky but as long as your not traveling with it it's OK, not a lot of velocity but it gets your hair dry in a decent amount of time
Quiet and hot, but not powerful I read the previous reviews commenting on how quiet it is, but I was disappointed to see that it also meant it was lacking power to dry hair quickly. I don't understand the negative ion feature but it doesn't seem to make a difference. The hair dryer is ok, but I wouldn't have bought it knowing what I know now.
Not as strong as I would like, and a bit overhyped by magazines I know this was voted Best Hairdryer!!! by like 5 beauty magazines, and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently, but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to SHAPE their hair into styles (such as mohawks or fauxhawks). This is USEFUL for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair.<br /><br />I find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards (if you're going for a mohawk or even a pompadour) and keep it there (the way some of the stronger hairdryers can). Especially if you have a thicker hair structure (wavy, curly), or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction. Using more hair product helps a little, but a stronger air current will work better (even though it is more damaging for your hair & scalp, so USE CAREFULLY AND WISELY)<br /><br />I figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function, so I figured I'd help you all out.
This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use This is a decent hairdryer, but a bit cumbersome to use - it's larger than I thought it would be. Like really large. I recently purchased hot-boxed hair extensions, and bought this to make my life a bit easier (as I can't blow-dry upside-down), after a recommendation by my hair stylist. It works super well at the top of my hair (it looks amazing), but it's very difficult to maneuver around the head, especially the back, due to the weight, the size, and the brush. Make sure you give yourself enough time to dry your hair, as it will take a while trying to use this.
Ionic Hair Dryer It is ok..But I thought might be more powerful..but does the job for me since my hair is not very thick.  has some good<br />attachments also..fairly priced.
2nd one We orde our 2nd hairdryer because same spot in the bathroom-hholes already.<br /><br />But the drer doesnt last , 1. Year
Good Purchase... I was excited to get a &#34;TURBO&#34; Dryer. When I used it for the first time, I was disappointed with the pressure of air flow. I thought it would be more powerful. It is a good hair dryer but not The Greatness, I was expecting.
Three Stars Doesn't fit with diffuser of twin turbo 2600. Not a noticeable significant upgrade in power either form 2600.
This is almost perfect. I love the finish **UPDATE 07/09/17**  This dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece. It makes a click noise and then gets hot. I recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it. My husband and I looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on. I hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others.<br />Original review: his almost perfect. I love the finish. Very hot with several great settings. Its a bit heavy. The cord is a bit short. My hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times, knotting it and burning it. I have longer hair and this happens when I flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots. I have had to learn to keep space. I would buy it again though.
T3 I was disappointed with this product. It states it dries your hair 70% faster, but I don't find this to be true. Also the switches are in a very awkward place and I often turn them off by accident while using the dryer.
Just okay... Very heavy and bulky.  Does dry pretty quickly, but really can't tell a big difference from previous dryer.  Not bad, but just okay.
Great buy Very good buy for the price my only complaint is the timer is also the power knob.  When the dryer is on it ticks the entire time which gets annoying after awhile especially that one of the awesome feature is the dryer itself is very quiet.
Three Stars It's lightweight plastic and noisy, but they all seem to be more noisy.
My blowdryer is DEAD - 4 months later after install. Updated Review: 4 months after installing this blowdryer, it died. I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.
not too crazy about it It's a pretty average product.  My issues with it:   - heavy weight  - positioning of on/off switch is really awkward, you cant use your index finger  - the diffuser and concentrator are too long, with them on the entire construction is just way too big    If you're used to compact hair dryers keep looking, this is not it.  Having said that it still does what it's supposed to do - dries hair, and it's on the less expensive side of the range.
Not very powerful It's definitely not as good as the last Conair 1875-Watt dryer I had for 4-5 years. The dryer doesn't feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer.
Overall good quality for the price The hose from the base to the bonnet is rather short.  Overall good quality for the price.
Didn't last long. Worked well and as described.  Motor started to sound like a lawn mower, one week after it's one year warranty.<br />Not happy.
Three Stars It gets the job done quickly and effectively, for an old man who has little hair left.
Get what you pay for! You get what you pay for with this item.  It works with no issue,  but has very minimal power.  My hair is average thickness and shoulder length and it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to dry.  It's also not particularly hot.  It does get the job done though which is why I'm giving it three stars.  Spend a few extra bucks and get a better one.
It does the job... Funny, when you read a review, you might think...&#34;this is the perfect dryer; what I've always been wanting.&#34;  Well, I'm starting to think there's no significant difference between them.  I've tried several blow driers in a reasonable price range and am starting to think that I need to invest in a pricier one.  This one does the job, is relatively strong and is not overly large.  My hair is moderately long and straight.  But...it seems often frizzy and unkept after drying, especially at the roots.  I often have to use some product afterwards to reduce frizziness.<br />Overall, this dryer does the job and is a fair value, just not sure it's the one for me.
Too heavy I had to return this dryer because it was too heavy for me.  I thought my strong, volleyball playing daughter might want it, but she also said it was too heavy. Powerful enough but too heavy.
Get the 1600 watt one instead I have both this model and the 1600 watt hair dryer.  They are the same size but the difference is very noticeable.  go with the 1600 one.
Could be better I was expecting this blow dryer to be hot really hot but it's not. I don't know maybe is just me<br />that thinks that way. It gets the job done so I shouldn't be complaining.
Not a bargain here... I just bought this today at Walgreens Drug Store for 24.99, and this was not a sale price. Sorry, Amazon, I think consumers should be advised to check prices. I bought this after reading reviews on Amazon, haven't used it yet, but it looks good, light and easy to hold, and I like the hang up loop . I will update my review after I use the dryer.
Three Stars This hair dryer will suck your hair into the air intake.
It's okay-maybe? I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.     From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the going out sound bother us. You bet it does!     UPDATED: 12-30-2008  Yep, it did go out about a week ago, so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out.  Only lasted several months.
Not Bad I liked the lotion better than the spray for the body.  It went on smoother and darkened a lot faster.  Too bad they don't make it in a bigger size.  The smell was light, not too stinky.  It smelled good at first.  It was just a few hours later you could smell a slight sunless tanner smell.  The price is quite high for the wait time.  It was 3 weeks after I ordered it before I received it at my home.  They told me it was back ordered, however I didn't get this information until I called them myself.  A few days AFTER I called, they sent an email stating it was on back order.  They made up for it with a discount and a facial cleanser but I don't think I'll be ordering this product again.  I guarantee there are other ones out there that work as well and don't cost as much.
conairs are better compared to this. I am a professional and have tried many dryers. My personal one blew up so I got this one. It's not that great. Be prepared to dry your hair for 30 minutes.
great while it lasted my hair dryer died after 1 year, very disappointed This is the second one from Conair that this happened to, the other died after 6 months. Going to try a different brand
Since my hair is too thin, it dries it ... Since my hair is too thin, it dries it in a minute! But leaves it so hard frizzy :( it is also very, very loud!!! My duaghter loves it, her hair is long and thick, she does not complain. I did mot return it, my daughter uses it.
Simple hair dryer It's what I would expect from a 25 dollar hair dryer.  Not many extra, but does the job.
It works...just not like I thought it would When I first bought this, I was not a skeptic about it. As someone who largely believes in science, I am very well aware that pheromones DO exist. I've also always wondered what it would be like to wear these pheromones. After exhausting the internet, it seemed that all I could find were pheromones catering to heterosexual men. Then I found this, and again, believing that it would work, I bought it.    Unfortunately, after using it for a few days now, I do not notice any differences in the way people (gay/straight/male/female) interact with me. They have however taken notice to the scent, and they love the scent, but I see no noticeable sexual excitement in other gay men, or increased mood and friendliness of straight men.    Soooo, it is now my belief, that the synthesized pheromone technology does not work in this cologne. However, its not a total disappointment, as I've said, everyone does love the smell, so I will continue to wear it as a regular cologne. But I was hoping for the pheromone technology to kick in, which never did...
Not enough powerful dryer I used to have a turbo power hair dryer which is very powerful but the 3000 is little bit dissappointing because the dryer is not strong enough and bigger than I thought.
and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful. I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don't even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush. Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it, but I don't recommend if you actually want to style it using the blow dryer.
The hair dryer is quiet and powerful enough to dry ... The hair dryer is quiet and powerful enough to dry my hair, however, the on/off switch stopped working the first day. I did not want to go through taking it off the wall and send it back so I am using this item by plugging and unplugging the hair dryer as needed for use. The switch should last years, but didn't even work for one day.
clumsy apparatis - I wanted more mobility - like multitacking and this is not set up to run ... clumsy apparatis - I wanted more mobility - like multitacking and this is not set up to run with the flow - hose waned to stay on box and I wanted it to travel with me - my own problem - it was meant to be stable
Awkward grip on handle, it kinda bugs my finger ... Awkward grip on handle, it kinda bugs my finger holding it. Doesn't dry my hair as fast as other blow dryers I've had.
Hooded Dryer This dryer is good because it's easy to use, but, I have a couple of hang-ups about it though: #1. it doesn't have a timer. #2. the holes aren't well distributed for even heat penetration. Overall, it's a decent hair dryer. I use it to deep condition.
blow dryer item was shipped quickly. however i was rather disappointed at the quality of the item. it didn't leave my hair as soft as i would have liked it to be. it left my hair big and frizzy.
Do you like medium heat? Then Pass There are many reviews for this dryer, and in a nut shell, it works very well and does the job. I have two small complaints, but one of them is a big deal for me. I have medium textured straight hair that is very, very long. I like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat, is almost room temperature. It's not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50% longer than my old dryer to get the job done.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-nice feel in the hand<br />-nice frizz/flyaway control<br />-Low and high air flow<br />-3 temp. settings<br />-comes with diffuser<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Medium heat is too cool causing long drying time<br />-the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush, or wrapping of the chord<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy the same one again, but really, it's just a hair dryer!
Everything as it says However, I would have prefered a more diverse group of piks.  I bought my husband a waterpik for christmas (which he loved).  I wanted to get a set for myself, but this one only has 3 types (none really as cool as his) and dups of all three. - It's a good beginner set I guess... but I will be searching for some of the better ones that came with his. I can't complain about quality - look closely at the piks - if you want two of each of the basics - this is pefect for you.
The styling tip does not stay on, The styling tip does not stay on, keeps falling off in the middle of blow drying and then it's too hot to put back
love it sorta love the wall mount. Turns out it wasn't all that easy to mount, especially if you are patience impaired. Four months later it over heats and shuts off. I do have long (almost hip length) and thick. It generally takes 30-45 min to dry my hair. I can't blame the hair dryer for over heating. It usually takes 3-4 minutes to cool down and finish the job. I don't like that it only has 1 heat setting. A &#34;cool&#34; air setting would be GREAT! Especially when it is already hot and humid. The night light is VERY bright, not a bad thing, but it could be turned down just a tad. I think I'll do more research before I buy another one. But I definitely do love the wall mount.
Worked great for 3 years then burned out.  Going to order a new one I guess for $30 in is worth it. Worked for 3 years than burned out.  Decided to order another one since I have the wall plate already on the wall.  I guess for $10 a year it was worth it.  Although I hate to throw it in to the dump.
Hair feels smoother and moisturized, but dries no faster and the dryer is heavy The drying speed is actually no faster than my $20 1350W hair dryer. The &#34;quick dry&#34; head dries even slower than the &#34;precise dry&#34; head. And in my opinion the dryer is HEAVY. But my hair does feel much smoother than before. It does its job to retain the moisture of my hair.
Hot Air Heat stops working sometimes. Still blows air.
Three Stars Air flow was not as strong as I'd hoped it would be.
heavy and too big I bought this hairdryer in Europe. I dont know what idiot is designing the 'look' of this hair dryer but how about creating form AND function? First of all this hair dryer weighs a TON.. I didnt realize hairdrying was considered a workout.  Also the dryer handle points away from the drying air flow which makes it difficult to dry the back of your head? I keep burning my back.<br /><br />The only saving grace is that the speed actually works well.  I would NOT recommend this product based on design alone.
5-Mar makes hair straight but oh my god. it plugs out every 5 seconds.
Huge No complaints on functionality but it is WAY bigger and heavier then I expected based on my previous cord-keeper folding handle Conair.  I supose I should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but I guess I assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around.  If you own a seperate hair dryer for travel, this could be a good option.  I think it would be best for the teen age crowd, it is awfuly pink too.
It's Okay Not very strong. Does the job. Doesn't have a lot of heft so it makes me think it won't last long, which is fine since we don't really love it.
Not for Large or Jumbo Rollers It is a good product if you're using small or medium rollers.  The bonnet is too small for Large or Jumbo rollers so I only used once and packed it in my closet for whenever I decide to cut my hair shorter and can use smaller rollers.  It only came with one attachment, not two like the picture shows.  I like how you can store the hose, bonnet, and power cord inside the case.
Love the concept. Like the product. No more!!! Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.<br />Update ; I had to take it down as it came down all too often :(. It didn't hold for any reason that I can fathom :( !!!
Lots of Wind and Little Heat I find it to be very high volume of air but the heat is low. The difuser snaps on poorly
Cord is TOO stiff. I would have expected the ... Cord is TOO stiff.  I would have expected the cord to be supple.  Alas, the cord behaves as if it's frozen even at a temperature of 84 degrees F.
Poor quality The dryer light stopped working after 3 weeks. It did not matter much. Today, exactly 1 year and 3 days after my purchase the on/off switch stopped working and I had to use the breaker on the unit to turn it off. I called the manufacturer and confirmed that the warranty is 1 year, but since it is just couple of days over, they agreed to send me a replacement. It is a direct connect so I need to take the wiring out and replace it with a new one. Oh well!, at least I got a replacement.
Takes some getting used to. Takes a few minutes to warm up and the full force setting creates tangles in my hair but I am working with it and getting used to it. The medium setting seems to work well with fine hair, the jury is still out on this product.
Andis hair dryer cost more than in regular store....should have check around other place instead on one store before I bought this one<br /><br />
It's like a giant robotic arm Works well but you need a lot of space to store it.  It's like a giant robotic arm.
Conair hair blower Like this hair blower, however I was not too happy went I saw it at Walgreens for $25 on sale as compared with your price of $38
So Far, So Good This dryer is perfectly adequate.  I'm not as exhuberant as some other reviewers, but I can't really find anything wrong with it.  Size and weight are fine.  Noise level is fine.  I find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and I don't have trouble with them.  I don't think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer, but I do have less static flyaways.  My hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy.  Not sure how much is due to the dryer.  The one strange thing is I couldn't find anywhere that said how many watts it has, and now I own it and still, none of the packing materials, box, insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts, which is odd.  But it has enough power for me (my old dryer had 1875).  For $40, its fine.  Had I paid the $259 supposed sticker price, I'd be disappointed.  I've never used the more expensive models though so I don't know if they are any different.
Weak motor Not as powerful as I had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back.  Otherwise, works okay.  Retractable cord is nice.
REMINGTON TSTUDIO SALON HAIR DRYER THIS HAIR DRYER IS EXTREMELY HEAVY. IT IT ALSO VERY HOT AND PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU DRY YOUR HAIR ON HIGH.  I HAVE ACTUALLY SAW MY HAIR SPARK WHEN DRYING. SO PLEASE USE CAUTION.
Sharper than it looks It does the job. I could use a bit longer razor, as it is a pretty small head. It's also a lot sharper than I thought it would be.
Exploded while drying hair Loved my Andis but it just exploded while drying my hair. Plastic everywhere, lucky no one was hurt. I don't hate it but it could be unsafe! trying to decide if I want another one or switch brands.
Just okay The hairdryer blows air very softly if that's such a thing.  Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.
Melts easily After 15 minutes of constant operation the connection betwee. The two parts started melting. Other than that everything else is pretty satisfying.
OK for the price A decent dryer for the price. However, I was expecting more air flow and quicker drying for 1875 watts. My previous Conair dryer, which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts, put out more air. Still, for the price, this one gets the job done.
It's a really good value for the money It's a really good value for the money.  It is a bit heavier than I am used to and if just got s bit hotter it would be perfect
OK but has it's drawbacks Bought this because I wanted a retracting cord, and so many reviews RAVED about the dryer itself.  After using it for a few weeks, I can say the drier is fine BUT<br />1) 3 speeds with 1 temp each (you can't go medium heat, high speed, for example - it's low/low, med/med, or high/high<br />2) the cord doesn't fully retract, even with some jiggling.  It retracts enough for my purposes (I leave it plugged in under my sink, and drop the unit in a basket)<br />3) it's kind of noisy, but does dry hair fast so overall exposure is probably less
Great while it lasted... I really very much liked this hair dryer while it lasted, which was about 6 months.  If I had written the review earlier, I'd have given it 5 stars.  But, suddenly, the high speed fan stopped working, the low speed works, but it's hotter than it was (which scares me a little).  It gets such great reviews, both on Amazon and Consumer Reports.  But why did it die so soon?  My previous cheep hair dryers have always lasted for years!  Now the best Amazon can offer is approx. 50% refund if I send it back since the 30-day return policy is past.
Worked great...but only for THREE MONTHS I would not recommend this hair dryer since it only worked for three months. It was purchased in August and now, in November, it will not turn on.<br />However, if you are not as unfortunate as I am, this simple hair dryer is very surprisingly quiet and gets the job done very nicely.
Product Description falls short of accurate The hair dryer does exactly what it's intended to do. However, the product description is inaccurate. The so-called cool shot button does not exist on this product. One thing which I noticed though is that the product image was updated with the blue cool shot button removed in the new image.
Three Stars Good  but loud
It does the job It's a very powerful hair dryer, which is fine, as I have a lot of hair.  It's not too heavy and there are two settings for low heat and high heat.  However - the retractable cord stopped retracting within 30 days.  And the plug is very clunky - it's something that would be needed in a hair salon, not necessarily your home.  But it was only $14.95 and if it lasts 5 years, I will be happy.  The one that it replaced was a Vidal Sassoon (remember him?) that I bought 15 years ago for about $12.00, so I way got my money's worth out of that!
Very short cord! The hair dryer itself is a great dryer for the price. I had owned one for 6 years before it broke. So I bought another one. But this one is a revised model of the original one I bought when these first came out. And they have considerably shortened the length of the cord. Very bad for  salon use or if your outlet is more then two feet away. Other then that I have no complaints about this product.
Three Stars The attachments don't stay on too well and the cord is really short.
Three Stars Basic dryer ,no expectations beyond the one you had previously
Industrial strength dryer with retractable cord I like the retractable cord of this dryer the most, the dryer itself is very loud and heavy, everytime I dry my hair it feels and sounds like I'm running my vacuum cleaner.<br />It does dry hair-but I'm not feeling the ionic part of the dryer, I had a different brand before that worked way better. At least this one dries decently. I am going to keep using it, but probably wouldn't recommend it to friends.
Just not for me. I like this hair dryer, but it's just not well suited for a man's use - especially in the gym.  I had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months.  It is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air - too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear.  It's also much heavier than I expected it to be.  I decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment.<br /><br />A word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit.  The first time I used it I had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me.  I still have a sore spot on my finger a week later.  Be careful when opening.
Switch defective The product is good. Working Properly, the variable speed switch is defective. It's not going on HIGH. Please Help !!!
Just OK The hair dryer itself is OK, not great (doesn't seem to get very hot), but OK.  However, my biggest issue is the location of the buttons. Every.Single.Time. I blowdry my hair, my hand either automatically switches the settings to cold or a low setting.. they are located exactly where I'm holding the dryer! I can't stand it!
Pointless While preparing for a few weeks in Europe, my girlfriend mentioned bringing her hair dryer. I explained that hair dryers can't simply be plugged into an adapter. You need a complicated, often expensive, voltage converter that can handle the power draw of a high wattage appliance.<br /><br />I figured for the price of a converter we could likely just find a 220v hair dryer and then rather than carry her giant hair dryer, AND a bulky converter, we'd just have one compact device.<br /><br />As it turns out, we stayed in several hotels, and ALL OF THEM had hair dryers in them. We didn't need to bring anything at all. Moreover, this one is pretty weak, and the ones in the hotels tended to be much better.<br /><br />So my advice is this: if you're going to Europe, don't bother buying and packing a hair dryer. Just use the one in the hotel. And if you should happen to find yourself in a hotel that doesn't have one, you can probably buy something better than this one for about the same money while you're there, and you'll have saved yourself the hassle of packing it.
It's nothing special... There are many models that have the same number of speed and temperature settings, so the only reason I chose this model over others was the retractable cord,  The instructions tell you to be careful with it and to never over extend the cord. I babied this thing, but the retractable cord stopped functioning after several months. The high speed setting is equal to the medium speed on my old hairdryer. It dries my hair, but plenty of other cheaper models would do that just as well.
Does the job, but very very painful! I purchased this product hoping for something that would eliminate my hair problem or at least help keep it under control. This product does exactly what it says it will do and works well. Very durable, you don't have to worry about breaking because it is indeed a spring. But WOW, does it ever hurt. I just can not put myself through that pain on a daily basis and if you don't do it just correctly it increases the pain by 1000 times. This method of hair removal is much worse than waxing. If I had thicker, tougher skin that wasn't so sensitive I would love this product but it is just too much pain for me to handle!
it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn't feel like it is just going to snap in two This dryer is just cheap.  Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  Granted, it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn't feel like it is just going to snap in two...unfortunately my other one doesn't have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  But hey, it's only for travel...
Three Stars it's not very powerfull but it woks properly
Three Stars a little big for me. Hard to carry with travel
It worked fine with the adapter Used this hair dryer in England last month. It worked fine with the adapter. My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot. I dry my hair in sections and I could hardly get a section dry before my scalp would start to burn.
Flimsy but OK The dryer is working fine so far. There's no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than I would like. I move it around with care and support it with both hands. For the price I expected to be so. In the future, if I adapt to it, I might fiddle with the design and make it more stable. Do not expect wonders.
Dryes quickly but super loud! Bought this for my mom to try it out because her $150 dryer went out after 9years and she said it dryes almost as quickly as her old one but is super loud! And does not leave hair feeling or looking as smooth and shiny as her old one. You get what you  pay for.
Broken ring The product works fine, it just has a broken ring on the end of the drier so if you wanted to use the defuser, you can't.
I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor ... I actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly, had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again
good but damaged Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.
OK  in my book I am a hairdresser of 40+ years...needed this for my very occasional jobs at home...it will do the job...easy to store (biggest reason for this choice, over one on wheels)  Somewhat noisy (who cares) WONDERFUL heat...could use some more air holes.  This is not made as good as the one I had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old...but that is true about everything...can't see how it adjusts in height
I really really wanted to like this hair dryer I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle. After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don't pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product
It does the work. It's nice and dries quickly, just it's super noisy, can wake the neighbors up!
Requires extra work for mounting by screws. The product itself is a 4 - 5 star product. It is just right for my wife's needs and the night light is a welcome plus. The 3 stars was for installation. I found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security. I drilled the holes. Then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through. I had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger. This took several trips as I wanted to make sure they weren't too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole. Very frustrating and oh, so avoidable by the company. Once installed, the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall. I hope it is fixed in the future. If this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal, this would have been a return.
travel dryer?? I purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews.  I thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too.  I did not use the dryer so I can't review how well it works.  The size even with the cord retracted was my problem; it was as large as my 'home' hair dryer & that is why I returned it.
Elchim Hair Dryer I have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory!  My daughter has the original one and it's still going.  I however, purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn't putting out the amount of air it did in the past.  So I replaced it with another one and it's only been months and it doesn't get as hot as it used to.  Very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform.
Works, but has a smell to it. I'm a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process.<br /><br />My last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic. Worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat.<br /><br />This one had good reviews and was cheap. So I bought it.<br /><br />Although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job, exactly what I wanted, it smelt like burning plastic. Maybe it's jsut a new hair dryer? Regardless, I am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this.<br /><br />I plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product. Wish a company could make a small, powerful hair dryer for $20 that just worked and was durable.
Didn't last This hair dryer started out great and I loved the added night light feature.  It did not last long at all so now I'm shopping for something to replace it.  My poor wall, this will be the third dryer.  I am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year.
Too much preparing before sending! You kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment, and that I would get it on the estimated date.  I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out--I could have had it sooner.  My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!
But... When it works right it is my dream blowdryer.  Yes, the<br />controls can easily get flipped around, but the temp and<br />air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile<br />curly hair.  Whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers<br />is nothing desirable for me.  They always frizz me out.<br />  I use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air<br />pik to straighten and volumize my hair, or use round brushes<br />and vary the heat along each section of hair.  No matter how<br />I style it, I come out with much shinier less frizzy hair.<br />Rewind about 2003-2004: Bought this model in a store,<br />loved it, and used it til it died in about 2007. Bought<br />another from a different store.  Everything was fine at first.<br />Then when I would use it the breaker would trip.  At first<br />it only happened once or twice, which is just one of those<br />things that can happen for no good reason.  I bought another<br />after the electrician ok'd everything.  I figured it was just a<br />bad dryer.  So I bought one more from a different store.<br />Worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end.<br />After a burned hand I decided I should try and find another<br />dryer.  Around 2012 I was talking to a friend who works in<br />the salon industry and she told me the company that made<br />my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them.<br />That made me think it was worth one last shot.  I have moved<br />from where I used all my other dryers.  First couple dries went<br />great.  However, I don't trust it not to use it in a non GFCI<br />outlet.  Last couple times I used it the GFCI activated and<br />turned it off.  Now I'm convinced it is a safety hazard, or<br />at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn't<br />need.  I'm heartbroken over that.  If the manufacturer could<br />address that problem, I would be SO happy.<br />The seller on Amazon was reasonably priced and got my<br />item to me quickly and ingood condition.
broke in 6 months I have had this blow dryer for 6 months. The first five months it worked great then all of a sudden it fell apart. The blow dryer started over heating and then it would shut off then the attachment wouldnt stay on anymore and the comb broke into pieces. I have bought new comb attachment pieces because I dont feel like buying an entire new blow dryer.
Okay I like this blow dryer except for several issues.  I have short hair so use the low speed setting mostly. It is fairly quiet unless you turn it on high speed.  Then it's loud.  It is much heavier than my old Revlon blow dryer that I finally had to replace.  If you have long, thick hair this would be pretty heavy to use for any length of time.  The diffuser has very hard plastic fingers. Wish they'd make soft, pliable ones that would be more comfortable to lift and twist hair. The retractable cord is a great feature and works well if you follow the instructions.
Otherwise it would be a great hair dryer Really hard to turn on the switches. Otherwise it would be a great hair dryer.
Nice dryer Nice hair dryer for everyday & travel.<br />Has on-going problems with the retractable cord.
This Conair Is Full of Air Not as good as the original Conair 1875. Makeovers and upgrades don't always yield the best results. For instance, this 1875 replica. Lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have, such as temperature adjustment. There is only a setting for high and low fan speed. Also, in order to use the air only feature with no heat, the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function. This causes a person's fingers to get tired, holding a button over using a sliding switch. Then there is the retracted cord that is missing. That was probably the most valuable feature for the original Conair 1875. Made the dryer much more portable. Even useful when not traveling. Now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter. The original is much better. This is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller, but overall not worth the investment.
great while it lasted I loved this...while it lasted.  After 3 weeks, it stopped working.  I also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because Amazon is not a registered dealer. The seller has agreed to replace it when I mail the product back. Just be aware of these potential issues.
Good Hair Dryer Good Hair Dryer.  Nice weight, cord good length.  I just had to get used to the button location, it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally.
Good but Not Great I bought this hairdryer for an upcoming trip and wanted something compact yet efficient.  After several uses, the cord stopped retracting all the way, and instead, only goes in about 2/3 of the total length.  I expected this to happen eventually although I was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner.  So now I have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord, leaving about 1/3 hanging out.  Other than the cord retraction issue, it is a great hairdryer.
Disappointed that 2 years have gone by and it died Disappointed that 2 years have gone by and it died.  Seems to be the life of these hair dryers as this one was my 2nd.  Not sure that I am buying a 3rd as I don't feel like buying a new hair dryer every 2 years.
Two settings: Too High and Too Low I am getting the funny smell on high as others have described.  In addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle, it's also hotter than I can handle.    The fan speed and temperature are linked, as there is only one switch.  The low speed is too low, but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed.
Not my favorite Goes on thick and doesn't blend in to skin. I also got some sun burn.
NOT IMPRESSED I was not impressed with this product. The hair dryer is pretty heavy compared to some of the other ones on the market, additionally the low speed setting still blows your hair too much, making it harder to style your hair. However, it does come with a diffuser which is something that you don't normally get with a blow dryer.
Ok but will be looking for something different Works well but both of us frequently turn of the hair dryer by accident because of knob placement..
Three Stars Longer than I thought it was from the picture.  Actual dimensions are needed.
My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison The weight is inordinately heavy! Why? My old dryer weight was like nothing in comparison.<br />It does the job, but I'd recommend a lighter model to a friend.
Three Stars The turn on/off switch is really hard to move.
Three Stars I have had better, Not very hot.
Andis RC-2 Hairdryer Not Made for the Long Haul This product has some nice features. I have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home.  I was surprised when the first one I bought died after barely passing the two year mark.  I may buy another one just because I like this dryer but I definitely know what to expect now.
Does the job, blows fine It does the job but fan makes a funny noise when powering down.
LOUD & got weird noises. I am just not happy with the really loud noise. I bought this based on the product's the minimal negative reviews and customers' reviewing it quiet. Other than the really loud noise of the dryer even at its lowest mode and the odd noise it makes when being held facing up and at the cool and warm modes, the dryer is very solid and a quite heavy. I tried the attached concentrator, the wind would not concentrate when blowing extremely closed with my ceramic round brush.<br /><br />Extreme fast shipping and fast refund. Still a happy customer after the good service. :)
Decent cheap hairdryer, no cool air setting I needed a quick replacement for my spare dryer and wasn't interested in spending much money.  This one has two settings, a nice grip, and a little loop for hanging it.  It does not have a no heat setting like the one it replaced, and is pretty noisy.  Ours has also, after just a couple of months of daily use, developed a bit of a rattle when used at certain angles, which to me indicates that it might have something loose or just out of tolerance and that the dryer may not hold up long term.  While this met my needs, I'll likely be replacing it with a more expensive, slightly fancier model.
Three Stars Loved this hair dryer, but just after a year of use, it just stopped working. Was really bummed!
Good dryer but not my favorite. I bought this dryer specifically because the handle could collapse and the cord was retractable, which I thought would make it fit in my drawer.  Both features work well but, it still wouldn't fit in the drawer.  This dryer does not get very hot so it takes longer to dry my hair than my previous one.  However, it was a good price and you get what you pay for.  I'll keep it but I would try another model before I bought this again.
Cheap but good. On my 3rd or 4th one! I am my 3rd of 4th one of these. In my experience, they usually last about 1-3 years of daily use before it dies and you have to buy a new one. It doesn't do anything fantastic for my hair, but it gets the job done. It is the only one that I have found on the market that has a retractable cord, and for that reason alone I continue to buy these. This time however, the cord stopped retracting about two months of using it, so that was really unfortunate :( Will continue to buy until I find something better at a decent price with a retractable cord!
It works... It works, I didn't expect anything wonderful since the price was low. You get what you pay for, I guess!
Doesn't get hot enough I would like it more if it reached a higher temperature. takes a long time to dry hair. I have thick hair so I need a hair dryer that gets hotter.
decent value cuz its so inexpensive switch is all wiggly, power is relatively weak, and somewhat loud, but it has been working so far and it is inexpensive
Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer I found the Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer very hard to turn on, choose my heat selection and choose the intensity of the blower.  I think Conair should have made the ridges on the two selectors more pronounced.  I also found the low setting far too powerful to comfortably style my bangs.  What I do like, compared to other hair dryer makes is that the cold air button was extremely user friendly.  The dryer itself works just fine and is comfortable to hold.
I wouldn't recommend it for this hair dryer The diffuser works well...when it isn't falling off my dryer. I just bought a Conair 276R Infiniti Pro Volume Dryer, and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up. I wouldn't recommend it for this hair dryer, but it might work well for others.
Mediocre This hair dryer is not as strong as I was hoping.  It's ordinary.  It was cheap enough so I won't bother returning it.
I like it, it dries my hair quickly I like it, it dries my hair quickly. However, I have long, wavy hair, and it gets caught easily in the fan of the dryer (ouch.) I wouldn't necessarily recommend this dryer for curly hair, even with the diffuser my hair gets pretty frizzy and falls flat.
Good temp range, but.... So glad to have a hair dryer that had a good range of temperatures.  And so much less noisy that my old dryer.  But the location of the buttons make it difficult to hold.  And the high speed does not work unless I press down on the top of that button. I will keep it, but am disappointed.
Worked well, but died way to early Hi, would have given it a 5-star, as it worked really well and was powerful yet quiet.  Unfortunately, not even a year old and with no warning, one day the on/off switch no longer flicked on and off (like a spring had broken inside or something) and I had to throw it away.  Also, the filter is not easily accessible, like with some hair dryers that have a trap door that opens so you can reach them.  The only way to clean the filter is trying to shove a paper clip or pipe cleaner in between the vent slots and see if you can somehow pick the hair/dust out of the filter.
Hair Dryer It's just okay, it's kinda loud, but it gets the job done.  I do however prefer the Carel dryer that I had in the past.
Good Blow BUT Doesn't Last-Cord Breaks Consistently The Elchim 1800 R/B hairdryer performs great. I should know because I've had 4 of them.  I keep buying them on average 1/18mos.  This IS NOT good.  The systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector. I'm thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem. This has happened to me on all 4 Elchims I have purchased. My hair stylist confirms what I have found. He said that he constantly has to repair the cords on Elchims. The cord is NOT round as stated in some other reviews.  It is the flat type. Wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation.
Good in a pinch The bonnet is not quite big enough for large rollers, so the heat does not circulate well.  I'm still looking for the old-fashioned hat box dryers that I had in the 60's.
Okay, not spectacular Not as powerful as I had hoped; the speeds and temperature control are sufficient. Still takes a while to dry my long hair, so this is not as impressive as some. Still, for the price, it's fine. The true test will be how long it lasts before breaking...
Three Stars Kind of weak, not quite powerful or hot enough for my liking.
More girly than shown in pic Careful, gentlemen.  The picture online and on the box shows it has silver trim, but it's actually bright pink trim (switches, filter cover, ect.).  Has a narrow mouth with a penetrating stream that's probably better for long thick hair than short hair.  Heavier than expected too.
Not As Quiet As Described. Its small and mobile but it is not quiet at all. When i purchase a quiet hair dryer all i expect to hear is air blowing. Not the motor at all or even fan for that matter. I have had quieter dryers than this one in the past.
Ive used it about 6 times and it's still in good condition ( also keep in mind that I am ... I'm not completely impressed with the cheap plastic although, Ive used it about 6 times and it's still in good condition ( also keep in mind that I am hispanic and have very long, thick and curly hair ). I purchased this because my daughter has one and after using it, I fell in love. But, hers is definitely made with better quality materials, you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality.  I thought I was getting a super steal based on the price I paid for it ($25) opposed to what my daughter paid ( she purchased hers directly from Andis for $52) As I previously mentioned, mines is still in good condition after using it several times, I'm just waiting to see how many more uses I get out of it. This is a case of you get what you pay for.
Not As Powerful As I thought This hairdryer isn't as powerful as I thought it would be. I have cheaper ones from Target that blow more air. I got it for the cool air switch and it does work fine.
NOT SO SURE My biggest disappointment was when I couldn't attach the end cap so that I could concentrate more on the strands of my hair. It's like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn't click to the dryer. It became so frustrating. But for the diffuser, it remains to work just fine -- only because I hardly ever use it! I bought this  dryer years ago which is a plus, but I have had issues with it burning some parts my hair. The ion button switches off on its own.  I don't regret buying it, but it's not as great as I'd like it to be. I gave it a 3 stars.
Three Stars Cap is too small to put over my rollers.
Meh I upgraded to this dryer from my basic Conair dryer and thought I would get something good based on the reviews, but really, it was a waste of money to simply buy another blow dryer. It doesn't do anything better than previous ones I've owned, and in fact, seems to make my hair slightly MORE frizzy. Plus, the buttons are placed right where your fingers wrap around, so I had to train myself to hold it differently as the first few weeks I kept switching the buttons in the middle of drying. I've seen other complaints about the motor shorting out, and so far, I haven't had any issues like that, just not really impressed with how it dries my hair. And no way is it really quiet. Pfffft.
It works like a charm for 4 months  then suddenly stops working I fell in love with this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel, and took a picture and found this exact model at Amazon.  It works like a charm for the past 4 months. Very good heat, low noise ( my 5 years daughter hates hair dryer with loud noise but she likes this one).  But it suddenly broke last week.  I had to run to a shop to get a hair dryer.<br /><br />But would I buy it again, may be.  since it is so cheap, the price of one of my lunch.  I may bought two, in case one breaks.  This is just me.
Alternative to obsolete Conair 1600 I bought the Andis 1600 hair dryer as an alternative to the Conair 1600.  The Conair 1600 is now impossible to find anywhere, but I don't like the more up-to-date 1875 watt Conairs as they blow either too hot or too cool.  The Andis has four settings instead of two or three on Conair dryers, which provides good heat control.  It's very robust and not too heavy.<br />What I didn't know when I originally wrote this review was that the first one would only last 8 months.  However, a replacement dryer I received under warranty is still going a year and a half later, so maybe I was unlucky the first time around.
Works very well but is a little heavy Since I am using this on almost a daily basis (to take to and from the gym) I find it to be a little more heavy than I would prefer.  However, it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz.  I like that it has the cool shot option.  I ended up getting the Baby Bliss travel dryer because it is about 1/2 the weight and I really like it.  However, it doesn't have the cool temp option so I'm hanging onto this one for backup.
So so Won't return this, but it seems a little wobbly and doesn't work particularly well with my beth room outlets.  The folding mechanism doesn't seem to lock the the unfolded position.  Good power and blowing temps.
Good, but I'm not blown away Pardon my pun in the title, but I'm not overly impressed by this blow dryer. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was it's weight. It's quite heavy, and much heavier than my last two blow dryers. I don't know if I'll get tired of holding something heavier, but I am hoping that it's an indication of quality.<br /><br />I do like the three heat settings, two air speeds and the cool shot of air, which can be used while drying. It is quieter than my last dryer, which was a Conair with the same wattage. The dryer is a little awkward to hold, however, and I had trouble changing heat and speed while holding it midair and drying my hair. It did dry my hair faster but not by much. I used both attachments to see how they work and diffuser worked like it should - giving curl without the frizz. I had trouble getting the concentrator attachment on the end, and then it blew off the dryer both times that I used it. I don't know if mine just doesn't fit well, but that was a little annoying.<br /><br />It may seem like I'm being knitpicky in this review, but I'm just trying to cover all the bases for a blow dryer. After saying all that, it does what it's supposed to do - dry my hair. If it lasts longer than my last two blow dryers, then I'll be really happy.
It's OK Only lasted about a year and then burned up.  It is only used once a day or so and you would think it should last longer.
Light weight, not too noisy and plenty of airflow ... Light weight, not too noisy and plenty of airflow. Not sure it will last a long time, but well worth the cost. Bought two of them.<br /><br />Update since reviewing this, both units have failed in the same way, power switch stops working. Too bad, these are cheap, light weight, not too noisy and good airflow.
Three Stars This compact hair dryer is very powerful but too loud.
Looks like a toy hairdryer! Startlingly small and flimsy looking, with a thin plastic grill over the fan. But does a decent job, with good air on the high setting. I'd never rely on this for every day or for a long trip, but since it's so light and small, will keep it on hand for overnights.
doesnt last This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall. I won't buy another one. I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years. thats crazy. yes I use it everyday but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old. This hair dryer lasted 2 years!! thats ridiculous.
Best for long hair! An excellent dryer, but heavier than most. The retractable cord is a great feature, but adds to the weight.
In-home Peel There are not many in home peel treatments on the market any more, which is unfortunate. This peel does an excellent job of exfoliating and is not over-drying like some alpha hydroxide peels. However, the concentration of alpha/beta hydroxides is relatively low compared to what you may get at a dermatologist. Even on my sensitive skin I did not get overly red or flakey. Additionally, this peel seems to helped with oil control on my oily skin-especially when used consistently over time.     I do have a few complaints, one is the smell. Although it is not over-powering it takes a bit of getting used to, it smells like the old lanse-sa treatments at the hair salon. Another complaint is I do suffer from acne and this product seems to aggravate acne problems if used during a break-out. A word of warning, this stuff is very difficult to get out of hair so be careful where you apply it.    With all that said it is a luxurious treatment that helps exfoliate skin in a way no exfoliating rinse can do, and helps with oil control. I have not noticed any dramatic wrinkle reduction or dark spots disappearing like the professional peels deliver.
If you are looking for a hairdryer, then great. A hair styler? not so great. As a hair dryer this is a good product, it has plenty of oomph it is not too loud, it looks good.<br />But if you bought it like I did, for styling your hair, using the attachments that came with it, you will be disappointed.<br />the boars hair bristle brush is the only useful attachment out of the 3 that come with it. The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it. After one use, those boar bristles were leaning every which way but straight, so the brush was effectively ruined after one use.<br />I got a refund on it.
It's ok I read these reviews and thought I had found a miracle product.  I have medium-thick hair, but it is long, and there is a lot of it.  My hair is usually somewhat frizzy after blow-drying.  I have used the Ion Stylist for over a week now, and have not noticed a difference in drying time.  I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature.  The real test, however, will be this summer in the NYC (subways!) humidity.
Was great while it lasted Was great while it lasted, but the first time I tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again...and it had been 90 days, so no refund or exchange.
Conair not the same Conair use to be a great product, and due to the fact of personal use over thirty years of different hair dryers, I purchased this model. The folding andel, and retractable cord were attractive to me, but the dryer did not last a year. I used it every morning for three to five minutes, but everything now a days is built cheap, and doesen't last. Same with this model. Great size for travel, or small storage, but don't expect it to last.
Does the job I like this product. The chord is long enough. Noise level is not too loud. Two power levels. The only reason I only gave it three stars is because I don't know if it's going to last.
Not a bad dryer This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly.  I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it.  The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though.  The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane.  I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while.
Three Stars The ends are pink. Not what I expected
Nothing special Despite the hype on this product, do not expect less frizz-- it is not one of those specifically ionic ones.  My sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one, said that she had better results with other blow-dryers.  Ionic blow-dryers give my thick hair a smoother, healthier result, but this blow-dryer does no wonders.      Blow-drying time is also not very short (I have long, semi-thick hair and it takes FOREVER to blow-dry...  air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time.   Can you blame me for not liking to use this blow-dryer?).  I like the cool setting, but other than that, nothing cool.  I can't believe I invested into this blow-dryer!      On the other hand, it seems to be reliable and may last a while.... but all of my cheaper blow-dryers did last a while also (in fact, I still have them but I wanted an upgrade).    I like the separate vent cleaner.  No more clogged vents!  That feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one.  I feel that this was a poor investment.      I have no idea how the other reviewers got great results, but my great results came with great products.
International Travel Pro: The hair dryer worked well in Greece and Turkey. The size and power are great.     Con: The screw head like button that you turn to change voltage is down right impossible for an average female to operate. I had trouble at home turning the button with a coin as recommended by the tech support people when I called for assistance. I finally had to use a screw driver! Now I leave the setting set for European voltage and just use it for foreign travel.
ok but heavey ok but heavey<br />nice does its job but looks small was supprized how heavey it was.<br />has all the heat adjustmentas I was looking for
So heavy The moment I pulled the dryer out of the box, I thought - wow, it's really heavy comparing to my old dryer.  I love the color, but color is not the main feature to consider when buying a hair dryer, right?  I haven't tried it  and afraid I will not be using it, since I am not loving it. Probably, it will go back to the store (It didn't come from Amazon).
Three Stars Heavy, my expectation was much too high. The $ cost was high too.
Not as advertised The filter that I received was not an OEM filter as advertised. It fits very loose.
This is the second one we have mine is still ... This is the second one we have mine is still going strong after two and a half years...and my daughters bombed out after 2 months and we have to get it replaced
Hope it works I just bought this dryer so I have yet to use it. I just wanted to thank all the ladies for their reviews.  It helped me choose this dryer. I have been using the Conair 1875 translucent blue dryer for two years.  I had to buy a new one each year why? good question, b/c it stops working. I used it last night, and went to use it this monring and ah ha, it doesn't work! It didn't fall noone else uses it it just stoped! I was going to but the Conair ion blowdryer but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair, the dryer never did anything, and if you live in NY you know what the seasons are like here, I have long thick wavy hair that I dry straight, so I'm hoping this dryer really does work I'll let you know, but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase.
Hot?! Not... If you're looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows &#34;luke warm&#34; air, then this is the one to get. But if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do, this one won't do it for you.
Too heavy and large for travel I purchased this for a trip I was taking to Mexico.  It arrived on time and was exactly as described.  Unfortunately after looking at it and feeling it's weight I decided to return it.  As you know the airlines have strict weight limits on luggage. Given I was traveling for two weeks out of the country I need the room in my luggage for other items.  In order to reduce the weight something had to be left behind and I chose to forgo the dryer.
A little disappointed in Amazon this time... I spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer I wanted to purchase and I decided the Conair Infiniti Cord Reel was exactly what I was looking for. I always go to Amazon first when making a purchase so naturally I checked to see if it was available. It was in stock, listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping I placed my order right away. When I got home from work today the Amazon box was waiting for me - Woo-Hoo! my new hair dryer! - I opened the box and instantly knew that what I was seeing was not what I had ordered. It was made by Conair, was the same color, had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the Conair You Reel (see the picture I posted above). I called Conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer. I was told by the Conair Customer Service Department that You Reel is a subsidiary of Conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the Infinti it is NOT the Infiniti. I called Amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money. Since I haven't even plugged the hair dyrer in yet I wanted to try it before deciding to return/refund it. I have had several Conair hair dryers through the years and I'm sure this one will be just fine (I will update this review after I use it a few times). I've never had any problem when ordering from Amazon and will continue to do so but I just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case what you see is not what you get.
Fine for my short hair Nothing to complaint about its functions.  However, it is way too heavy to hold for more than a few minutes.  Fine for my short hair, but not for my daughter's long hair.
Decent buy Connectors always comes off. Overheats. Put on medium setting and it gets the job done. Not 100% what I wanted but it works.
Too big I was looking for something to travel with, that is why I was attracted to the fold down and retractable cord.  I tested it and it seemed to work fine but it's too big for travel, even with the handle folded.  The price was good so I may keep it as a back up to my regular hair dryer but now I need to look for a smaller one for my suitcase.
It was great while it was working and wife loved it but ... The hair dryer I purchased in June has burned up and has to be replaced. It was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1/2 months.
Nothing special I'm not that impressed. I didn't notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair. And it's heavier than my old dryer. However I did notice that my hair does look smoother.
Not exactly useful Much smaller than anticipated - not sure what they measured for the dimensions. It is also fairly weak if you have thicker hair.
hair Dryer This is OK for personal use but not a beauty shop.  The extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver.  Heat is OK not real hot.  I would recommend for home use only.
For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes ... For me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes longer to dry my hair than I expected. It's just okay.
Bit bigger than expected This looks and feels quality and definitely dries fast and is powerful. It was rather bigger than I expected from the image though.
its alright, but it could be better When I first came across this product I thought this looked gfeat and I wanted buy it. Whwn I received it in the mail, I still thought it looked great but it could definifintely use some improving. The case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes and I havent even dropped my phone!!!
Worked Great for a few months Loved this hair dryer the first few months I used it until it started cutting off in the middle of drying my hair! My last hair dryer lasted YEARS but this one only lasted about 4 months.
The item was not brand new It's a good dryer, but it am downgrading it for not being brand new. The item we received was an open item, with signs of usage. The package was not sealed and the manual was missing.
Hair Dryer Broke After Two Months Initially I really liked this hair dryer.  It worked well and ran quietly, but it suddenly stopped working.  While it worked fine yesterday, when I plugged it in this morning it just wouldn't turn on.  Because I've owned it less than two months, I've requested a replacement through Amazon to give it another a try.
Must replace bonnet/connector We received this product on time and in good condition.  However, after about one month the connector on the bonnet came loose from the bonnet.  Poor job of attaching this during manufacturing.  Now must replace the bonnet and connector and having an awful time finding out where they may be purchased/replaced under warranty.  Does ANYBODY out there have any idea on where to go?[[ASIN:B000BBGS40 Hot Tools Professional 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer]]
It over heated I had a Conair hair dryer that gave out finally due to usage and age.<br />This one was powerful enough but since I have thick shoulder length<br />hair, it takes longer to dry and the Conair automatically shut down.<br />I had to wait until it cooled down to be able to turn it on again.  I sent<br />it back because I do not have time to waste until the hair dryer could<br />operate again.  Handy size, but too many minuses.
Used Open box Part missing, Not new as advertised You get what you pay for Wason the verge of returning product Hope I don't regret it
It's ok My trusty Hot Tools dryer that I bought from Ulta died on me after two years of daily use...so I decided to get this one given the reviews. This is a lot lighter than my previous one but it doesn't seem to have the same power and oomph Hot Tools Pink Dragon Ionic Hair Dryer had...it still gets the job done tho...The only thing I'd say sucks is that it doesnt come with a diffuser and the nozzle is an odd oval shape it's not like I can buy a universal diffuser to fit it. =(
Not good!! The hair dryer is also heavy and ... For the price (and based on other reviewers), I was expecting a lot more.  I have very long, thick hair and the Sedu Revolution does dry my hair faster (cut about 10 minutes off drying time); however, it actually makes my hair more frizzy!  Not good!!  The hair dryer is also heavy and loud!!!  Based on the packaging, it looks like I received a previously used blow dryer that someone else returned.  I would never recommend this blow dryer to anyone!
Looks like a good idea though I have thick Polynesian hair so in my case, it doesn't give off enough blow power to get through my large mane. Looks like a good idea though.
I loved this hair dryer, but... I have owned this type of hair dryer for about 8 years.  However, this particular hair dryer I just bought in September 2013 to replace the previous hair dryer that was the same as this, but it was a different color.  It has worked perfectly well until the other day.<br /><br />I don't know if anyone else has ever had this experience ever!  I have sometimes left my dryer plugged into my outlet after blow drying my hair and this time was no different.  But after my last usage on Tuesday I became sick and paid no attention to the dryer laying on the counter in my bathroom.  But I kept smelling a sweet smell coming from the bathroom area and just thought it was my plug in freshener.  I had just bought a new insert.  But the next day I saw a puddle of red underneath my dryer and I saw that the area next to the plug reel up was melting!!  Really, does something like that happen.  I pulled the dryer plug immediately and put the dryer on a paper towel and it continued to seem to melt.  Red kept flowing from it for quite awhile.  This could have been a fire issue and something inside the dryer overheated.  I don't know.  But I do know I feel uncomfortable using it and threw it away and will have to purchase a new one.  To Conair ... shame on you for manufacturing such a shoddy piece of equipment!  If anyone be able to illuminate me on what happened or has experienced the same thing, please reply and let me know.  Oh and I gave this dryer 3 stars because it worked perfectly up until the melting.  In fact I'm upset that I won't get to continue using it, but I won't take the chance now.
Retractable cord worked great for a few months After continual use, the cord eventuall stops retracting all the way and that is a disappointment.  Dryer itself works great but we purchased this because of the retracting cord.
not even a year and the cord stopped retracting I bought this for the retractable cord, used it barely three times a month since I got it, and the cord stopped retracting. Still a decent buy if you get it on sale, since it works as an ionic dryer should. Would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn't stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use.
Great for the price I've had this shaver for over two months now. Being in my early 60's, I've been shaving a long time. Having had many shavers in my life I'd rate this one as a good shaver. I've had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more. For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price.
It Works I bought this kit for the screwdriver, and while it is small, it does work.  The kit comes packaged in a sturdy plastic box.  Overall, it works.
Small but powerful hair dryer. When I ordered this hair dryer, I ordered the black with Pink petals. What I received was an all pink hair dryer. I was a little disappointed that I didn't receive the actual hair dryer that I ordered and I believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one. I have ordered other hair dryers from Xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers. This hair dryer is nice and small, so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer. Even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it. To me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer. It was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers. It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong). The feature I like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn't frizz when using this dryer.<br /> I was able to receive this hair dryer so that I can provide my honest opinion and feedback.
Not recommended for curly hair I have wavy/curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls... This hairdryer was actually too powerful (even on the lowest setting) for my delicate curls.  If I was going to blow it straight I'm sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls, I needed the diffuser to diffuse more (It felt like the diffuser wasn't holding back any of the air) and the air not to be so powerful (on low).  I ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight Revlon.  I wouldn't recommend this dryer to someone with fragile/lightweight curls but I would recommend for everyone else.
Liked old one better The original sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer was much better.  It was smaller and easier to use.  This is ok since I can't find the original
Three Stars Works well but extremely loud.
Just okay I saw the other reviews and thought this was the dryer for me. Well not so much. Yes it did make my hair less frizzy. But my main disappointment is that it doesn't have enough power nor did it dry my hair quicker.
TURBO The heat and power is good, but in keeps shutting off in certain outlets of the house.
Awesome but.... Awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn't last long before it started giving problems. For the money paid, expected the product to hold up longer.
Okay but not curly enough Tended to make my hair frizz instead of curl
hair dryer nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment.  You can put items in, but unit will not close
Three Stars Great when it works but tends to overheat and shuts down.
Not a lot of power. It takes a lot ... Not a lot of power. It takes a lot longer to dry long hair than with other dryers. The brush attachment is also a little too soft for hair straightening.
The on/off switch broke The dryer works well for the price, but unfortunately after only a few weeks of use, the button that controls whether the dryer is on/off and the speed came off. I took the dryer apart and set an interior switch to the &#34;high&#34; position so that whenever I plug the dryer in it will turn on at the high speed. I'm not sure if that's safe, but it allows me to continue using the dryer. Since the dryer was so cheap when I bought it (under eight dollars), it's not such a big deal, so I give it three stars.
Hurricane or puff of breath.... two extremes This blow dryer has two settings... hurricane or puff of breath. Not much in between. It's great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you're used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge. It is fairly light, which is why I bought it. Overall, it is OK.
Be strong girls Nice hairdryer but it is very heavy to hold up for too long.  If you have short fine hair, you can tolerate the weight, but if your hair is thick, mid length to long requiring longer drying times....holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be.  I prefer my old Revlon Ionic Pro Sylist.
Very heavy and doesn't blow air as hard as expected I bought this based on other reviews indicating that it would dry my hair faster. They say 40% faster and I suppose that's accurate - 40% faster is really not as big of a difference as you would expect. It's also incredibly heavy considering there's not much difference between this and your usual hairdryer. If you want a good workout every morning though, then definitely get it!
it's a little weak not sure if it's because of the attachment, but even on the highest setting this dryer just isn't that powerful.  I have a really short pixie cut and it's taking me almost twice as long to dry as my old cheap-y dryer...humm.
So sad to replace it . . . I got this dryer about 8 months ago, and it is does not turn on anymore. The buttons were very difficult to work, but the longer I had it, the easier it became to slide them. It does have heat settings which I like, but the retractable cord is not very dependable. After trying out different hairdryers, I realize how much I liked this one despite its fallbacks. I guess I just got really attached to it.
Great power. Melted diffuser. I've only ever used Conair (I've tried the T3 and other fancy dryers and they are horrible, not to mention they don't come with diffusers) and it's always been good on my curls. The heat output on this one is insane, and my hair always looks good. Only problem is that I've had the thing for a few months, and the diffuser is completely melted. All the little sticks are bent down and it gets tangled in my hair. Conair should either answer their customer service emails or sell diffusers separately as well so I'm not left without one. FRUSTRATED.
After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle ... After having it only 2 weeks the low blow cycle blew...I'll continue to use until the other blows but I won't buy another.
Heavy, Loud but works Purchased this without much research, so I am to blame for not &#34;loving&#34; this.  It's heavy, loud and I prefer more ranges in heat than it offers.  The attachments work well.  It's mid-sized, so if you're wanting something light and small, this isn't it.  Mid-sized and heavy......I would not buy again.
Wife didn't really like it Wife didn't really like it. Wasn't impressed. Works fine though.
It keeps blowing a fuse! It has plenty of power and dries my hair quite well. The problem is that it seems to short out and I have to reset the fuse constantly. Perhaps it is overloading my circuit. But my old one never had this problem.
Three Stars Its ok... light weight but noisey.
Worked well for a while.... then died :( I bought this product last year. It worked extremely well while it lasted. It died today. I guess I have to purchase another dryer again. Not sure if I will buy this one again or not. I think a hair dryer should last more than a year.
Not that great. Did not last that long had to replace it with another brand. The heat element died too soon I thought.
Disappointed with shipment I'm sorry that I have rate this product 3 stars without trying it out but I would like to share what happened with this item. I received this package today and was really excited about it. When I opened the box I saw at least 4 small bugs crawling around in it. This was enough to make me immediately close the box and bring it outside my house. As for the product, it looks great and as pictured but I didn't get a chance to try it because I am sending it back to Amazon tomorrow. I don't believe that this pest issue would be from the product so I think it must have happened in the warehouse/packaging stage. I'm disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try this blowdryer but I will not be ordering another one for fear of the same thing happening again.
It is ok This hair dryer works well, however, after about a year or so of use, the clear plastic coating around it, has started to peel off. This speaks to the quality of the materials used. It still works and I still use it but just wanted to mention that. It is pretty light, which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry! The main reason I purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands.
Dryer My hair is curly, so I think this dryer is not so stronger for my hair.
Too loud!! Not enough heat!! Too loud !! Not enough heat!!
A lot of hot air. I bought this for the diffuser for traveling.  The air flow is so strong that it doesn't really diffuse very well and my hair ends up being blown all over.  If you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine.
Eh... The hairdryer is only okay. I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don't like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I've had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn't super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn't dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can't hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can't. I'll definitely keep this hairdryer until it's time to get a new one, but it didn't impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn't a BAD hairdryer, but also it's nothing special.
Three Stars My hair still stays frizzy but it does dry a bit faster.
Not dual voltage If you are looking for a dual voltage travel this is not the one. I'm not sure if it works well, I returned it because it wasn't dual.
The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the ... The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter.  I like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that I can't style the back of my hair easily.  I have shorter arms but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  Do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer?  I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.
Andis hair dryer Good, light weight dryer. Would be perfect if the attachment would stay in place. Dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place
Works great for her Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter. Works okay but doesn't put out a lot of heat. Works great for her, she has short hair. However I have shoulder length hair and it would take to long for me to try and use. Great value, for younger girls it's sufficient. I would recommend a better blow dryer if you have a lot of hair or don't have a lot of time to spend blowing drying your hair.
Twin turbo Bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years. Purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power. I received my new twin turbo and I am pleased with the wright , power and   Attachments I am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor. Ouch and it burns your hair. Basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined.
Heat settings don't seem right. It's not exactly lightweight, but it's also not a compact dryer. I find the weight to be average. However, I find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high. On the lower speed, it is warm. And, hot is a bit too hot.
Decent dryer, Installation glitches Base does not fit flat to the wall because of protruding round head screws on back of base. Remove screws before installation. One of these screws had broken it's plastic receiver anyway and was holding nothing. Mounting hardware (1 screw) missing and too small<br />to hold securely anyway. No mounting instructions. No drywall mollies. I actually like the dryer itself. Nice thick cord, decent power on high.  Low setting on the dryer is totally useless . If your handy like me you can make the installation work for a perfect fit.
Not that different really! I have very naturally healthy and shiny, very straight dark hair, like that of the Native Amercans. My hair holds a curl very well. I already owned 2 different kinds of ceramic wavers and was looking for a more natural and less kinky kind of wave. This waver is ok, but not really what I expected. In my opinion it is not much different than the other wavers that are not described as DEEP wavers. I do hold Hot Tools brand in high regard from owning their products for numerous years. I would definitely take this deep waver over the other regular wavers, but wish I wouldn't have invested more money into the same kind of thing, more or less. I also do not like the dial adjustment used to set the temp on this because it is loose and changes on its own. I taped mine down so that it wouldn't accidentally set to a higher temp and burn my hair. Hope this is helpful.
Could use more air speed Seems like a mostly quality unit but the highest setting still doesn't give you a lot of air speed, just a lot of heat.  The cold shot button is hard to push where it is located, and should have been placed on the opposite side of the handle.  Notice that the fan speed slows and becomes erratic when using the cold shot button, but returns to normal after release.  Unsure how long this unit will last.  Not sure where the &#34;ceramic&#34; part of the dryer comes in since the internals look like a standard heat element setup.  Don't like this as much as the Vidal Sassoon unit that it is replacing.
Sad SO I haven't used it yet but I was pretty angry to realize that I paid double the price. I had no idea where to look for this dryer and of course my always trusting amazon had it but when I went to Target I saw it for 19.99. I am a little upset, probably fair game but nonetheless sad.
not quite what expected This product came up in a search for travel hair dryers.  It is NOT a travel hair dryer.  On the down side:  Heavy (probably because of the cord retracting mechanism, which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with), handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick.  The bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where I keep hair dryers. And it's a ittle too loud.  On the good side: Does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair, and I really like the results. The price is fair.
Annoying Hair Dryer I bought this hairdryer after my Sharper Image was dropped after years of service.<br />The Pro was well-rated by Good Housekeeping, that seemed to bode well. However, after using it 3 times I must say that it is an annoying tool. I use a round brush, and the slightest movement turns the hairdryer off or onto another setting - happens 4-5 times each time despite trying to get used to it.  The switch is not designed well.<br />It also has a high speed and a low speed, but the desirable middle speed is missing.<br />The weight is good, seems very light, and the price is good.  The hairdryer does leave my hair smooth, but I would advise you to keep looking, and not settle for the Pro.
Decent for the price I got this item on sale. I like that it is small and my diffuser fits on to the end (the nozzle on my old dryer was too wide), but the coolest setting is still quite warm, and it starts to smell like it's overheating after about 10 minutes of use. I have short hair, so I only use it for about 10 minutes, but overall, it gets the job done.
Buttons are flimsy and odd This hair dryer functions properly and is light enough to maneuver, but the buttons are a challenge (and I'm a middle-aged person). You need to slide them up to manipulate the heat level and another parallel set of sliding buttons to turn it on. It's a struggle every day.
Oh the Buttons. THE BUTTONS! I thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me. Nope. Almost every time I dry my hair I hit the temp or speed button... at least 2-3 times. It's does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that I would recommend to keep looking. I like it but can't wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer.
no height control Its not terrible dryer.  My only issue is that they listed &#34;Adjustable Height Control&#34; as a feature but YOU CANT ADJUST!!!!!!!! False advertisement.  I wouldnt have purchased it if there wasnt a way to control the height.
It's ok To much noise but does the work.
... my daughter it isn't hot enough for me but awesome for my 10yr old to dry her thin/fine hair Bought dryer for my daughter it isn't hot enough for me but awesome for my 10yr old to dry her thin/fine hair with
Go to great lengths A nice hairdryer, it does what we need. We were disappointed that there was no out of the way storage for any  excess power cord and that the power cord was not coiled to reduce the length of usable cord.<br />It is now three years later, and I must revise this review. I guess that three years is probably not terrible for the life of a hair dryer, but for something used less than five minutes a day my wife was expecting better. About a year ago it began making an extra noise when it was infrequently switched to high speed, so she really limited that use. Anyhow, right at the three year anniversary of its first usage, the propeller<br />blades disintegrated and jammed the motor causing it to begin smoking and smelling really bad before she could get the plug pulled. We certainly will not be replacing it with a like unit.
Okay It's good for the value; but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer.
Hairdryer way too noisy! This hairdryer is the loudest one I have ever owned!<br />I'm actually thinking of buying another and using this only<br />for travel.<br /><br />Other than that, it's very lightweight, compact and dries<br />well.<br /><br />Because it's so loud, I would not recommend this to a friend.
but I was disappointed when I received it because the power cord is ... Bought as a replacement for the previous version of this dryer because it finally stopped working after more than 5 years, but I was disappointed when I received it because the power cord is way too short and the power itself is not nearly as strong as the previous model. It'll work for now but I would definitely not buy it again.
Better for the summer Bought it on sale because it said for normal to dry skin, and I have dry skin.  It's too thin to be a real dry-skin lotion - I think it might be okay for the summertime, but for my winter-thirsty skin I definitely need something creamier.  Too bad, because I love the smell.  It's a soft, citrusy smell that's not too overpowering but still wakes you up and makes you feel happier in the morning.
Flattens hair My sister-in-law is a hair stylist and swears by this brand but when I used the dryer, it didn't do anything special for my hair at all. In fact, it made it look so flat and left my hair without any body.  My hair felt smooth and soft, but it didn't necessarily look that way. Even on the highest setting there's not a whole lot of power, it blows less air and doesn't get as hot as my previous dryer - I had an Elchim and it was definitely better.  Not sure if the wattage has much to do with it, this is 1875 and my Elchim was 2000.  But the 1875 should be fine for my hair since it's normal and not too thick. If you want the flat, straight-ironed look and have thicker hair, this might work for you.  For the price I paid, I wasn't impressed.  For the record, my sister-in-law's dryer performs much differently, even though it's the exact same model.  That makes me suspicious that perhaps this was a refurbished dryer or maybe even a fake if that's even possible. The box was not sealed, though the packaging inside was fine. I'd be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience.
Small, works well, but not durable I bought this hair dryer two years ago, and it worked great for its tiny size. However, after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times, the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220. I figured I'd just have to keep it at that setting, as it still worked okay. But a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand.
Too cold The air coming out of dryer is room temperature at best and the cord rewind does not work. The cord only rewinds part of the way.<br />The only feature left to work is the folding handle.  That works fine.
Decent, but not pink This is a decent little hairdryer for the cost. But from the picture, I thought it would be pink. It's not pink, it's red.
Don't get too excited about it, especially if you have fine hair. I broke my wife's Babyliss TT 3000 dryer (guess they don't bounce), so I had to buy her a replacement.  She has fine hair that lacks body.  As I researched dryers I read that people with fine hair will get better volume & body if they don't use NEGATIVE Ion dryers but instead use NEUTRAL Ion dryers.  The price on the MK-II was about $30 more than the TT3000 (which she liked) but I thought that with all the 5 star comments (i.e. lighter weight, quieter, 4 yr warranty, etc.) it was worth it, especially since it had a Negative/Neutral Ion switch.  When it came I mentioned all of its advantages to her.  I was crushed when her first comments were:<br />1. Yes, its quieter than the TT3000 but that's because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the TT3000.<br />2. No, the neutral Ion setting didn't give her any more body/volume than the TT3000 did.<br /><br />It is 2.5 ounces lighter than the TT3000 (according to our digital postage scale) and she's OK with it's performance so I'm not sending it back but I wished I'd just gotten another TT3000 and saved the $30.  Maybe a $180 unit with neutral Ion's would give her more volume but I do know that if this one breaks I'm not buying another MK-II.  Sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so I didn't waste my money.  Personally, I like the build quality of the TT3000 also.
Not the miracle I thought it would be Spends most of it's time in my drawer taking up space and collecting dust now.  It is definitely not analogous to having a third arm.
Not as good as the one I had 10 years ago Not as good as the one I had 10 years ago. The old one was a better quality and this make hair a little frizzy
Not For Lined, Aging Skin I am 63 and really wanted to try this. I swirled and tapped and noticed that the places on my face that are Not lined turned out nice. But I wanted a little more coverage due to some spider veins and 2 age spots. So I put a second coat on and these lines under one eye really stood out! I didn't know I had them until I used this product! So I got some makeup remover and took off the bare minerals that was on top of the lines and they disappeared! On those, I put my regular liquid foundation (on the lines)and all was well.  <br />  I think you should have nearly perfect skin for this to work nicely.
Good dryer, but cord is NOT retractable The hair dryer itself works pretty well, but the retractable cord is completely misleading. It stopped retracting on its own after I used it twice. With that said, the folding handle still makes it easy to store. Good buy for the price.
IT'S OKAY.... I have it and use it when I needed (usually for my bangs) I don't like how it stiffens my hair when I blow dry it. I like the real thing when I blow dry my long thick hair...
Bleck - Buy Something of Better Quality I purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago after my old Conair died.  I like to use my dryers on low speed, but high heat.  Although the two settings should be independent, this dryer is just lukewarm on low speed.  It also made my hair fuzzy, and while it was lightweight - it felt cheap.<br /><br />I quit using it two months after I started using it and invested in a better dryer.  I purchased the Elchim 2001 through Amazon, and while it's a bit more expensive ($80), it's worth every penny.  I would not recommend the Conair 1875, unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess.
it's okay My main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor.  I've let it air out for days and it still smells..  It's a good product, and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers.  I've own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell.
Thought it would be cooler like it was on my previous hair-dryer Not as much power as expected; cool-shot button is same temp as lowest heat setting. Thought it would be cooler like it was on my previous hair-dryer.
Compact & easy I have used a wall mounted hair blower for over 20 years, the first being one made by Sears & then an Oster (I still use this one.)    The Sears is no longer made and the Oster has a reset on the plug which made it difficult to use in this case.    The Sears & Oster are better made but look very similar to the Jerdon.  The first one sent by Amazon had a defective button so they immediately replaced it.    The Jerdon is a little noisy, the reset buttons on the side of the unit are hard to work but the hairblower seems to be working fine.  I have only had it for 3 weeks so time will tell if it holds up.
nothing special The weight of this item isn't any different from the others I've used. Slightly heavier than my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer it my opinion. Seems nothing special.<br /><br />I don't like the long nozzle. Perhaps if you have very long limbs, you wouldn't have as much trouble drying the top and top rear potions of your head.<br /><br />The wind output is pretty good, though. Comparable to my Healthy Infusions by Wahl Pro Dryer, it's about the same.<br /><br />No swivel cord. Buttons feel a bit cheap, but I guess it's a hair dryer... nothing fancy here.<br /><br />No, it's not quiet. It's as noisy as my other dryers.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to remove frizzes any better than my other dryers either.<br /><br />All in all, nothing special here. Just another dryer. I'd not pay a premium for it.
Not so great for my very thick/voluminous hair I have really thick hair that needs a lot of heat to dry and be styled. I was pretty disappointed right away by the 'hot' setting - didn't feel very hot to me. The only time the air actually felt hot, rather than warm, was when I turned the setting up to 'high' - and then I had to work so fast to dry my hair that if I made a mistake, I would have to wet my hair and start over again! The 'high' setting is no joke, it really moves the air. But I can't use it every day or else I'd look like I just walked out of a wind tunnel.<br /><br />Also, I didn't find the switches very easy to use, especially if my hands were even a little damp - was hard to get a good grip (maybe I'm just a weakling?). I much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb, if that makes sense.<br /><br />Anyway, it's not totally useless, I just had some issues with it. I will say the concentrator and diffuser attachments are great, but with the heat/speed settings, just not a good match for me.
Entirely appropriate for the price Infrequent user.  Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn't retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.<br /><br />It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.<br /><br />Temps are spot on with me; it's nice to know I won't get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.<br /><br />I've gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don't find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.<br /><br />My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.<br /><br />The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn't.  It's not intolerable, though. If it bothered me that much I'd glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb-knob or edges.<br /><br />I  &#60;3  love &#60;3  the surface. It's totally Lenovo (not cheap).  It's *great* (grippable) if you don't always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it's not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.<br /><br />My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.  There are other solutions, too. like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver.)<br /><br />I'd say skip this, frankly.  Go for one with easier switches and a lower decibel output... at a higher price.
Not my first Conair...... .....but this was the first Conair blow drier that i purchased with 'Confort Touch'. i was extremely happy with my purchase for 5 months...then i began to notice the comfort touch (rubber) coating was starting to feel a bit tacky. not just when warm...in use. after time it a lot worse. everything began sticking to it...dust bunnies....hair etc. and it also left a stickiness to my hands...that would take two hand washings to remove. after dealing with it for far to long..i threw it in the trash..happy to be rid of it !! buttttt...it didn't stay gone for very long. the following morning as i passed my son's bedroom i saw that horrible...sticky thing on my son's bed. when i asked him why he had taken it out of the trash and what he planned on doing with it? he said...it worked PERFECTLY in picking up years of 'stuff' that had fallen behind his work-station (made on solid wood. it's very big & extremely hard to move). he said he held on to the end of the cord and let the dry drop down to the floor. after dragging it from one end to the other a few times he retrieved a &#34;whole bunch of s%*#&#34;. ha! ha! that's my son! brilliant idea!! btw...it works wonders picking up socks...undergarments and sm. rags that fallen behind and on the sides of the dryer too. wellllllllll!?! i paid for it! hehehe! anyway....i'm still in love with conair blow driers though i have gone back to those made with hard plastic casings. we still have and use this blow drier. it's now used as a 'tool' to pick up things in tight spots. and.. it's now called... 'that sticky dryer whatchamacallit thingy'. :) mahalo (thank you) for reading my post. wishing you and those you love a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Always!!  Aloha & God Bless you.
It's ok It's very similar to those hair dryer you find in hotel rooms! it does what it's supposed to, but it takes a little longer and it only has 2 speeds (which is on the description)! It's a good buy for the price. But it doesn't fold, which would be harder to put in a suitcase. Overall I'm satisfied.
Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a ... Dryer itself works ok. Packaging is horrible. It came in a broken box and a tangled unraveled cord. Not suitable for a gift. Ok if it's for your own personal use.
Powerful and light, but the heating coil seems to be overheating I love how this hairdryer is so powerful without being heavy. But i seem to have a problem with the heating coil, it turns a bright red and starts smelling like its burning within 2 minutes of use.
Heavy Heavy and stopped working after . Worked well on my hair though but it was too heavy and didnt last long!
Three Stars The disk somehow smells like plastic
works well I have a bad neck and muscle spasm in my left trapizius so it's difficult to lift my left arm. The blo and glo holds my hair dryer so I can use my right arm to style my hair. I only wish that it could be left up permantently on my mirror with my blow dryer in it, but it can't. It has to be removed after each use or it will fall down on its own - it happened the first time I used it. I didn't know I couldnt leave it up (even though the directions say to take it down after each use - I didn't read that far - my bad). So, other than the hassle of taking it down each time I am happy with this product.
Still would recommend. Unfortunately, the heat element went out in my dryer less than one year into owning it.  The product is light and quieter than most dryers I have owned.  Definitely made my hair softer.  Still would recommend.
Super support Have owned 4 of the 30125 model units, I like the small size and heat ranges.<br />Andis support (unit replacement )when required has been in less than a week, no questions asked.<br />The high low switch is somewhat prone to failure which has occurred at least twice in the last four years; otherwise this model is quite reliable.
OK Works just fine.  I wish I had ordered a cord-keeper blow dryer, but that's my fault.    In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver.  At least mine was.
It's meh The string is too tight around the head. I wish they would bring back the gold bonnet one back. I had to settle for this one because I couldn't find that other one. But I'm not a real fan of this BUT it still gets the job done.
Not exactly what I thought I am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so. For the cost of the dryer I would have like directions to running the dryer. I have no idea what the difference is between Negative ions or neutral ions. This would be helpful since its all about the ions! Overall I feel like it is a good dryer just wish it had done all it was supposed to do for the price!
Does the job, but not what I expected. Does the job,but not what I expected.
It does the job I really like the hangup dryers because they save counter space. I don't like this as much as the  last one I had (when it stopped working I threw it away before writing down the manufacturer so I couldn't reorder it), but I'm sure I'll get used to it. It's heavier than my previous dryer, and I'd really like a setting that's between LOW and HIGH, temperature-wise. Fairly easy to attach to the wall, although the template wasn't of much use.
almost not quite I wanted something basic, relatively inexpensive, reasonably well made, and sturdy that would dry and style my hair quickly.  That is almost exactly what I got.  My only real issues with the dryer is the flimsy switch and lint trap cover.  The switch doesn't click into a new setting crisply. You have to go slowly and gently with the switch control in order to get any setting other than off or the highest heat/fan position.  The lint trap cover just pops off and takes some careful fussing around to replace securely.  Sometimes even if you think you have it back on correctly it will pop back off a few seconds later.
Heavy Duty! If you are looking for a professional type hair dryer this is a nice one.  It is a bit awkward for me to manuever as I am not used to this type of hair dryer....but the cold air is amazing when you are done drying....
so so it works fine, i am buying a new one. I thought this would be fine for work but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....
There is no place like home! This is a really fabulous red sparkle polish.  It's a good product and I treated myself.  :-)  It's a bit hard to take off, but most sparkle-polishes are.  As much as I like the product, I do feel it is a bit over-priced, especially when you add shipping.    If I was to come across this brand again, in store, I would buy it, if it was a color I had to have.
Great Hair Dryer The dryer was advertised as being much lighter than other models and I can't honestly say I have seen any difference in weight. I like using the dryer as it has several settings that help dry my hair.
Not great Doesn't get hot enough
Okay Mine malfunctions. A lot of times when I turn it on to low, it comes on on high and after a few seconds switches to low.
FINE ORDERED FOR Y WIFE. SHE SAYS IT HAS LOTS OF POWER AND DRIES WELL. THE ADAPTER THING IS TO SMALL. MOTOR IS GOOD AND ALL THAT. SHE WONT ORDER AGAIN DUE TO THE SMALL ADAPTER.
This sounds weird, but the night light is MUCH ... This sounds weird, but the &#34;night light&#34; is MUCH TOO BRIGHT.  I had to tape something over it to mute the light.  The mounting bracket is tricky to install and kind of flimsy too
Three Stars Good for about 6 months, then burn out.
brush attachment not for thick hair I got this to replace my gold 'n hot one that I'd had for years. The brush attachment is very thin and pretty much useless in my thick hair. The gold n hot brush had way more bristles that were sturdier. Other than that, it hets hot and dries my hair, but not as straight as the gold n hot.
Three Stars This was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out.
Larger in size than expected This is a 4 star product but I gave it a 3 star as it is a 'travel' hair dryer. It should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button. Like many women, I need all the room I can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels & B&B's have hair dryers in them (though w/o a cool shot button ofcourse). It is not a critical item in travel. It should be much smaller in size with the same quality & cool shot. It's 2012 & this shouldn't be difficult technology.
a lot of thick curly hair I used this product once and I want to take it back. I set my hair in medium sized rollers and I found that I couldn't fit my entire head under the dryer. AND it was incredibly loud. I must say that I like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair (that could fit in), but not hot enough to cause damage. In order to get back of my hair some air time, I had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down, obviously that wasn't too comfortable. If I can get rid of this dryer I will, but if not I will live with it. Next time I will go for a hood dryer with a more circular design, instead of the cone style that this one has, Im sure that'll help me to get my whole head in.
Good for the price I've bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good. It's not the best that I've ever had, but works well for the price.
Three Stars Awkward
Three Stars It's very hard to use the diffuser because the dryer itself is so heavy.
So so a bit disappointing Not as powerful as expected, but the fact that you can fold it really helps. Not the greatest but okay
Watch the retractable cord!!! I would have given this a better rating, because the dryer performs just fine. I especially like the variable speeds and heat settings.     CAUTION: Be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug.
Disappointing I had high expectations for this hair dryer and I am deceived. I bought it to replace my Babyliss hair dryer (dropped it too many times...) and preferred the Babyliss.     This Fhi hair dryer is a bit heavy, and it didn't make my hair shiny and soft AT ALL. It didn't even dry my hair faster than Babyliss, but I have to say I didn't try it on at the highest setting, cause it looked to me wayyyyy too hot for my hair to handle without major damage.     I guess I'll get used to it, but I wouldn't recommend someone else to buy it, not worth the price.
Three Stars Only last for one year.
Great blowdryer. it gets the job done Great blowdryer. it gets the job done. the only thing i dislike is how it is not compatible with universal comb attachments. also as i blowdry my hair the attachment keeps falling off
Three Stars Switch is hard to turn on/off.
An average hair dryer I had read all the reviews for this hairdryer and was super excited to try it out. Sadly, I don't see what all the hype is about. While it gets the job done (i.e. dries my hair), I did not notice any substantial reduction in drying time. Nor did my hair become shinier from the tourmaline. I'll continue to use this until it dies, but will not repurchase as a $40 conair dryer works just as well.
Too big Difficult to find a hair dryer with a brush anymore.  Very well made but much larger and clumsy to hold than the one it replaced.
Pretty Good ... description is deceiving. When the description said 2 speeds and 3 heat setting I was thinking that I could use them in any combination. NOPE .... there are 3 choices ... low, med, and high and the heat settings are preset.<br /><br />I also with that it had a cold blast button.<br /><br />However, I like the size and the fact that it stays out of the way so I kept it.
I'm not too impressed This hair dryer has a a short cord and you have to have it close too a plug. The other other issue is the on and off switch and the temperature level are too close to where you hold the dryer and the buttons switch on and off all the time.  It's hard to hold the dryer.
Its okay I bought this to replace one that burnt out on me. This one is much bulkier and longer than previous one so I'm constantly hitting myself in the head. It will take some time to get use to.
I like the fact that high heat does not burn and ... It is a little heavier than most hair dryers I have had. I like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow.  Wish it wasa little lighter weight.
... heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and ... The on/off and heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and feel it might not last as long as others.  I do not use often but others in family will.  Will have to see how it wears.
Lasted 1.5 Years Hair dryer stopped working after about a year & a half of use.  Worked great until one day, it stopped working altogther.  Kind of expected to be able to use this for a longer period of time. Perhaps my expectations are too high?!
My Take I would say it's a three pont five instead of a three. As long as you sit in the right chair and use the right table, it's not too bad, and have plenty to do. I got this to free my hands for other things sometimes, and I'm going to use it more now that it's recommended over hand-held dryers because it's less damaging to hair. I just have my hair down instead of rollers for faster drying, but going to start wrapping my hair so it won't be as frizzy. It takes about an hour to dry my hair. I'm sure it would be about the same if I used an 1875 wattage one. I would recommend it if you have the patience to sit under a dryer and have things to occupy your time with.
Three Stars It's ok, powerful, but the hot setting is TOO HOT and you can't turn it down much.
Good product With this product I definitely see an improvement in my hair. It's shinier and not frizzy with the horrible humidity!!
wrong item The picture on the web page didn't match the model number. I returned the item and they reimbursed me.
Not bad! Bought this dryer a year ago for under $40 hoping it would be better than most regular $20 ones. It didn't disappoint, I actually loved it. I also thought it was very quite even on the highest speed. The heat is so hot it dried FAST!! It's not light weight but since it dries my really thick hair quickly that was not a problem. Everything was going great till my mom and cousin used it one day and suddenly when I turned it on it went out!!!! Everything worked fine BUT the high energy speed!  It stayed on medium despite pressing the button to switch it. I was really dispointed!  With my thick hair and a baby on the way, I was not going to keep using it on medium speed, it would take me double the time to dry my hair!!! So I returned the damaged one and replaced it with a brand new one. That was my only option with my local store. This new one better last more than a year!
Three Stars I thought it would be smaller, for traveling.
Can not use in 220V countries I like this unit after reading product description. I ordered it. I have to travel to countries where we have 220Volt power supply and I purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only.<br /><br />When I received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package, I came to know I can not use this product with extension wires or with voltage converters. So this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me :(
Good basic hair dryer It's a pretty good sized hair dryer. Takes a lot of space to put away if you don't have a large sink cabinet.<br />Overall, it doesn't seem to require too much time to have your hair completely dry, however I really dislike the feel and design of the buttons (the ones to choose the temperature and the level of drying). They feel really flimsy and like they're about to fall off.
Good but could have one option faster Good but could have one option faster, but the rest work great for person how doesn't has a lot of hair.
The cord is too short. The price is great but the cord is too short. It came with all the attachments but it would have been so nice if the cord was a little bit longer, especially if the outlet is almost to the floor.
Noisy, but works After the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months, I bought another since my wife liked the style. When the new one came, it fit the bracket exactly as the first.  The only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one.  Not sure why, but it is annoying, especially in the morning.
It performes as expected. My problem with it is ... It performes as expected.  My problem with it is it's size.  I would never have purchased it if I had any idea how large it is.  It is so long that my arm is almost not long enough to keep from hitting myself in the head when drying my hair.
Three Stars I find that the heat doesn't stay consistent
It's not bad. It gets the job done. It's a hair dryer. I don't think it's horrible, but it's not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn't look it, but it is lightweight and it's a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

Fairly easy to install - lasted three years I have had this dryer for three years to the day and it died. Three years without continuous use doesn't seem very long to me.  Only reason I would purchase the same dryer again is because the mounting hardware etc is already there. Wish it had more power. Takes longer to dry my hair.  Others have complained about the green light - I wish it was blue, but it is nice to have that extra nightlight in the bathroom. LED so it doesn't take much electricity. And I don't sleep in my bathroom so it doesn't bother me.
Three Stars Nice product, but never got the diffuser it was supposed to come with.
The scent is not that great I have yet to use it tanning, but the smell is very musky and strong.  I was hoping for a sweeter scent.  It seems to make my skin soft though.
Andis hair dryer It dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud. Also there are 2 speeds but heat isn't adjustable--lower speed means less heat.
The blow dryer is awesome however the attachments fall off when trying to use The blow dryer is awesome however the attachments fall off when trying to use. We had to bond the comb attachment to the unit n
Yellowbird I purchased this product because quite a few of the Youtube vloggers I follow use/recommended it. I liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot, but I found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like I do, it heats up ALOT! I used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my (4b/4c) hair and it was fine. I accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair. There's not much that's special about this dryer, but overall, it's a powerful, not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer.
Heating element stopped working after 6 months I loved this hairdryer while it lasted, it had a lot of power, was not terribly loud, and dried my long hair quickly. However, with no warning one recent day it just stopped blowing hot air. Only cold air blows out of the unit now.
Three Stars looking for something smaller than this to travel with.
Be Careful -- It Runs Very Hot! This hairdryer worked OK for me but did not last too long.  It runs very hot on the high setting; I sometimes worried it might explode because it was soooooo hot.  Therefore, I mostly used the 2 lower settings.  One day, it quit altogether.  The one good thing about it: it was quieter than any other hairdryer I've ever owned.
it's ok...kind of i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair....i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago...they sure dont make them like that anymore, that one provided FULL drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too....which is what this one does...i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this...so ill keep it...it gets really hot when on the high setting (not the air the dryer itself) and on first use it tripped my electrical plug.....
Three Stars I liked it when it worked, but now it doesn't have very much power.
I ended up returning it... - First of all, it came in it's original packaging, but it looked like it had been opened before - multiple times. I was sceptical, but I plugged it in and tried it out. It was a little heavy, but worked nicely. Though I didn't like that you can't change 
It doesn't stand up to everyday use very well. I bought two just over a year ago and have had both of them fail after what I think is a short period of time.  My wife loves the way it dries her hair and she likes that they are mounted on the wall.  I ordered two more this time based on, in my opinion, the short length of time before failure only because my wife likes it.
Three Stars Not as strong as i expected
It's really good I love it! Heats up nice it isn't to heavy the only down side is that by the switches I have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together. Also the item I was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag. So far so good but I really hope it holds up
It's okay for the price. The switch is placed in the wrong place, because I accidentally shut it off all the time.  On the plus side, it is quieter than the last few dryers I have used.
Three Stars The blow dryer died after six months.  It just completely stopped working.
They don't make them to last anymore. My 30 year old Norelco died and they don't make the repair parts. My old Norelco worked fine with the original heads until the motor quit.<br /><br />The current model is cheap in price and feels poorly made. They recommend replacing the heads annually, but I'll use it until it fails and then toss it.
Positives and negatives The dryer has several good features, and I especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all.  Other dryers I've had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used.  Not this one!!!!  The downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment.  It is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b/c wavy hair not blow all over.  Luckily I was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently (prompting this purchase).  Otherwise I would have had to return this dryer, even as much as I'm loving the cool air feature.  Hence only a three star rating.
Straw not silk I read the reviews and decided to try this.  Maybe BaByliss spoiled me I dunno. My hair is way too dry and doesnt hold its shape. Returning and sticking with BaByliss.
Quiet but not enough power I have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output. While this dryer is quiet and lightweight, it did not have any more power than the $20 dryer I was using before. I could not find any wattage/power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual. I am returning it so I cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts.
Not the greatest hairdryer Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and it芒鈧劉s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz
Two years and blew up in my face This hair dryer gets HOT. I love the controls - separate for temp and power. I love the removable filter. I've had it for about 2 years and used it on the hottest setting daily. I haven't had any more hair breakage than the next person, several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair. HOWEVER, like these other ladies, my hair dryer just blew up in my face as I was using it. Sparks flew out where the cord meets the handle, & it's dead. Every hair dryer I've ever had dies like this eventually - looking for one as good as this that won't blow up or catch fire though.
OK, not great This dryer does the job, but it's a little loud, and it doesn't seem to get as hot as my last dryer.  It takes a little longer to dry my hair, but at the price I paid, it was still a good value.  I've had it for many months and it still works fine.
I am disappointed at the overall quality as I feel it should ... I purchased this unit a little over a year ago and had about 10 months of service using once a day for less than 5 minutes. It is an inexpensive unit and frankly did not expect it to last much longer. The unit fell to the floor from counter height 3 times.......on the third, the fan (a fragile clear acrylic plastic part) shattered and lost two blades. It is so imbalanced that it will now not, nor should it, run. I am disappointed at the overall quality as I feel it should have been able to withstand such impact. It is inexpensive however, and the moral holds true.......I'll look for a better unit next time.
Retrater Hassle I was surprised that it was smaller than I expected and by it's relatively light weight.But I had trouble pulling the plug out, as it was very stiff. When I finally got it out all the way, the cord wouldn't retract when I pushed the button. Also there is a scratch in the paint about 1/4 of an inch wide. Other than that it seems to work just fine.I like the cool setting.
Andis Hangup 1600 W I've been using these powerful little dryers about 15 years because they fit nicely on the side of my vanity under an extended countertop. The only problem is that they only last about 1 1/2 to 2 years with 2 people using them daily - but the price is right.
It was Great while it Lasted! Had this dryer for about a year and a half and it was great during that time. Dried my hair well, left it shiny. Only complaint was that the cord was somewhat short. Worked out okay for me as my outlet in the bathroom was in a convenient location. I used the concentrator daily.  After about a year and a half the dryer just stopped getting hot, only blew cold air. Decent dryer for the price but dont expect it to last very long with daily use.
And there she blows! Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I'd be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It's very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it's a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!<br /><br />_________________<br /><br />REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 =  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn't have to work that hard!  I'm disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.
Three Stars I liked it but ended up returning b/c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands.
only ok This hair dryer is okay. Bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short so you almost need to hold it on your lap when using it. Also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear. A bit concerned that I can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot.
Meh Not the best dryer I've ever had. It works, but it seems to take a long time to dry my hair, which is wavy, thick and coarse. I end up straightening my hair, anyway, so now I just wash it and sleep on it wet and straighten in the morning. I don't bother with the blow dryer.
SPA PURIFYING FACIAL WITH SEA MUD I received this product and enjoyed using this!  I was expecting a quicker result.  It wasn't a miracle worker for me.  Beth
Travel hair dryer Much bigger than expected. I was looking to replace a tiny yet powerful hair dryer. This one is not as compact as it appears.
Things to consider before buying this dryer A couple of things to think about before buying this dryer. First, the cord is pretty short. It's about 3 feet, and 1/3 of it does not retract (by design); so, about a foot of the cord hanging even when you are not using the dryer. Second, the there's no temperature setting, and the temperature is very low. If you have long hair, it takes a long time to dry it. For the price, this dryer is not bad, but for these reasons, I bought a different dryer. This dryer is now in the guess bathroom.
A Little Weak I have long hair which gets frizzy if I don't use a diffuser with the drying. When I use the diffuser with this dryer, it is not very powerful, works great without it.
Older product. I know this product has been discontinued so when I found it here I was really excited.  I used this alot and really like the way it works.  This bottle smelled a bit differently that my bottle I originally used from the store.  And didn't work quite as well.  But I still use it and it is better than some of the alternatives I have tried.
The dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up ... The dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up catching fire while I was using it. I think for the price it should last longer than 10  months.
Product intended for Japan. No English manual. The dryer looks good and works. I ordered this because a friend's recommendation. Honestly, I feel it is a bit overly expensive. I was hoping my hair would be smooth and shiny after use but the outcome was not that great. Plus, there is no English manual, only Japanese one. A bit frustrated.
Nice hair dryer I like this product. I really like being able to change the heat settings. My only complaint is that the controls are in the same place as my hand so I sometimes inadvertently change the settings.
Not as powerful as I had hoped I bought a cheaper model elsewhere but my dog chewed  the cord. Liked the other better.  Takes longer to dry hair
Its alright When I opened the box i was surprised by how nice it was. It has 3 different levels and the directions even recomend whates better for your hair type. Their is no problem with it its just i thought it would give off more heat. My hair is thick and it took longer than expected for it to dry. I am just gonna use it till it breaks i guess.
I thought I was buying the same dryer as my ... I thought I was buying the same dryer as my old one.  This one takes much longer to dry my hair and the cord is not as long.
The low speed doesn't dry very well. The high ... The low speed doesn't dry very well.  The high speed is very loud.  It does the job but I wouldn't buy again.
Not very hot Doesn't get very hot, take longer to dry hair
not that happy about this dryer I wouldn't have minded paying this amount for the dryer but it's really not good for travel after all.  It's much too large and heavy for tucking into a carry-on bag.  The name Featherweight is a bit misleading: it was more like the whole chicken plus the feathers...  Have sent it back to Amazon.
Only works if... I use this product along with conditioner and blowout serum. I got the Brazilian Blowout treatment in my hair and it's just phenomenal how I don't have to worry about my hair anymore. I do recommend the treatment before purchasing the shampoo, conditioner, and serum. After all, the only reason to purchase these outrageously expensive products is to maintain the treatment longer. I'm very happy with the treatment ($300-$600, depending on length), but I am not very happy with the products. They do leave a lot of dandruff. But if you paid for the Brazilian Blowout TREATMENT , might as well maintain it by using the correct products. I will only continue to purchase this product as long as I keep getting the Brazilian Blowout treatments.
Meh It can tip over if you are not careful and it is a little bit suffocating-feeling when you put down the visor. It is definitely not for someone afraid of small spaces!
Nice for the price. Nice basic hairdryer. A little slow on the drying though. A little on the large size. Does get the job done.
Comb attachment The comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair. The design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer. Thought that is the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!
Keeps frizz away, but takes forever to dry my hair While this dryer does a nice job of keeping frizz away, it takes forever to dry my thick, shoulder-length hair with it.  Even when I've used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I've tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it's taken me awhile to dry my hair.<br /><br />Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it's made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn't too heavy (so your arm doesn't get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.<br /><br />Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I'm wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time.
BE AWARE -- PRODUCT WITHOUT WARRANTY if bought here In order to register this product and receive the factory warranty, there is a label on the box that says we need to find a silver decal on the cord of the product. After an exaustive search, I figured out that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized reseller and we do not qualify for a warranty... even worse, they say that the product may be temperad or fake.<br /><br />I confess I am pretty sad with that.
It's Okay This is okay but I'm not fond of the smell.  There is another bhringraj hair oil on Amazon that smells way better and leaves your hair soooo soft.
Not a Flame Thrower I contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it.  But, even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product.  It has plenty of heat and power, runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features - high and low speed, warm and hot heat, a cool air burst button, and even ionic technology (for what that is worth), etc.  And it has an attachment for focusing the drying air.<br /><br />It is marketed to men but in the end it is still just a hair dryer, red and black and sleek - so really not any less feminine than any other dryer.  It does not shoot manly flame or melt women who touch it but if you want to dry / style your hair it should work just fine.
Great Dryer But Needs a Nozzle The retractable cord, the compact size, and the power are awesome! So is the price! It just needs a proper nozzle!
good drying, hard to work switches. I had same product before they changed the switches.  New switches are hard to adjust.  Other than that, it dries well.
Three Stars buttons interfere with handle.  always turning off
Andis 75370 ionic/ceramic dryer, It's OK, not Great I have thick and wavy hair type which frizz easily and takes a long time to blow dry using conventional non ionic hair dryers. When I first started using T3's pro ionic/ceramic hair dryer last year,I noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair. After using it for about two months, I'm very happy with the results. My hair became more manageable and is less frizzy. It is soft and smooth. I thought all the Touramaline ionic/ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results. So I was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that I can have two ionic dryers on hand. I read the positive reviews on this Andis hair dryer, then I decided to purchase it. I'm thankful the delivery was super fast! After using it a few times, I have to say the result is just mediocre. Compare to T3, this Andis model loses its shine! My hair feels dry after using it. It doesn't seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the T3 does. It works just like a regular hair dryer for me, except because of the ionic in it, it does dry hair faster than non-ionic hair dryers. Overall, here are the pros & cons in my opinion on this Andis 75370 Tourmaline ionic/ceramic hair dryer.<br /><br />PROS: It has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior; a good size for home use; powerful air flow; dries hair fast; 3 heat settings/2 air speeds; has the cool shot button;<br /><br />CONS: feels heavy on hand & noisy; heat settings/air speeds settings are in odd position, the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer; the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright, it's very annoying; the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn't impressive; not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic?<br /><br />The Bottom line: This hair dryer is not bad, it does the drying job alright. I just don't think it's great for those with thick/wavy & coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.w dry. If your hair type is normal & fine, frizz is not the major concern for you, you may be okay and satisfied with this one.
strong motor, but bad design The dryer has a major design flaw.  The control switches are where your hand goes so while drying my hair, I kept on having to constantly adjust the speed or temp setting.  It's very annoying.  I do like the fact they have a cool setting so I can use it to blow dry my puppies after they get a bath but I am thinking seriously about returning it because of the switch problem.
hair dryer for the size of the dryer, it's quite heavy and there is no attachment for the end of the dryer to direct flow.  less than ideal.
OK for what it is, could have had better heat settings. Ok hair drying but the heat setting don't quite work perfectly. The hot setting on high air setting messes up my curls a little, but the hot setting on low air doesn't get hot enough. other than that it is great for travel and unlike a lot of the reviews about the cord retraction  problem I didn't find that a problem, you just need to pull it out all the way and hold the button steady for it to gain momentum. Sometimes I have to help it with the last inch or two. but definitely it's not a big issue. what more can you expect from a tiny motor of this size. I would rather have this than a good motor that would also make the hair dryer heavier.<br />I am happy with what I have got for this price, I still think as far as travel dryers go this the best one I have seen so far.
Great drying effects. Very little frizz and it dries quickly. The dryer is heavier and larger in size than I expected. The control buttons are positioned in a way that your fingers can't avoid them while drying, so the settings are accidentally changed too easily.
It's ok A little heavy for a travel dryer
Meh Works pretty well, but I've been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer鈥?which I didn't have to do before, but now if I don't, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.
Works, but was expecting super fast drying When this hairdryer came i was super excited. I bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school (longer ago than I care to remember).  It works well, nothing special.  It's nice that the cord can be stored inside the dryer istelf, but leaves the plug portion just hanging out awkwardly so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer. It comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions.  it's okay, probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again.
Hair dryer Like the size and shape.  The only thing wrong the retract cord doesn't work.  Didn't last long, otherwise very nice
Good, but not great When my Conair IonShine hairdryer broke two months ago, I tried to purchase the exact same model.  I liked the way it made my hair look: soft, shiny and without frizz.  Although this newer version of the Ion Shine hairdryer should have improved on the preceding models, it falls short of my older version.  The switches, which respond to very little pressure, are placed directly where I want to put my hand and it is inevitable that I end up accidentally switching the hairdryer off or changing the heat setting.  The hairdryer is also a bit unwieldy if one wants to use the extensions.  On the plus side, it speedily dries my hair and leaves it as shiny as my previous Ion Shine.
Three Stars Works well, I wish this could be much smaller
You can only run this on low power with the 220 voltage It is nice and compact, however not showing in the description on-line is that it will only run in low speed when using the 220 voltage.  This wouldn't work with my hair therefore I had to return it.
The best at this price, but.. (FYI) only produces an adequate heat on the high setting, medium and low settings only achieve a warm temp. Low price, sturdy, long thick cord, very light, strong fan.
It's okay. This is an okay product. If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one. But for the occasional use it's okay
Good price, okay product Works like a decent dryer, but I didn't see any improvement in frizz-control. I have very thick, frizzy 2A hair, and this dryer could get my hair mostly dry in under ten minutes.<br /><br />The retractable cord is nice, as is the defuser.
Retractable cord: Great Idea when it works The retractable cord has become difficult to retract.  This occurred in a relatively short time.  Except for this difficulty, I like the product.
Three Stars Do not get hot enough and a little smaller than what I thought.
Not enough dryer for the price This is a little dryer, but for the price, it should offer more. For example, the air flow seems to come out of the unit at a strange angle. I've used the dryer for several weeks and I still haven't figured out how to make the most of the air. The temperature of the air is fine, and velocity is as expected for a 1600 watt unit, the direction is off. I was a bit disappointed by the knob to switch the voltage. You need a coin to turn the selection, and the plastic is so cheap that it was immediately, and permanently, gouged. If this unit cost $10, like some at Target, I would expect that, but this is priced in a way that one expects better quality. I don't think I'd buy this unit again.
User This model replaces an earlier one that put out a lot of heat, but the replacement  one, while seemingly appearing to have been upgraded, does not put out the level of heat as the one I replaced after several years of use. That one died. Also, the digital clock is not included in the replacement model. That was a feature much appreciated so without it I feel a bit more of disapointment. However, the replacement model does look smart mounted on the bathroom wall.
Andis 40055 Pro Style 1600 Hair Dryer The hair dryer runs a little hotter than I wanted.  Otherwise it is a good dryer for those who want a less powerful hair dryer.
Not like the Older One I had I thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable.  In the end, it's still a good product.
Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But ... Gets my hair dry. Folds up neatly. But it didn't do anything extra special to my hair. It's a hair dryer...and it dried my hair. It gets the job done n fits in my luggage. So it does what it's supposed to do.
Three Stars best blowdryer I've owned, I've had it for 3 years and still works as good as new.
Not the best, but it is okay. It's okay, but not the best. i was looking to spend less than 20 $ on it, for the money, it's okay, but it is not the best.
Great While it Lasted Bought the leopard version of this blow dryer because of the cheaper price and I LOVE it. It is a great blowdryer and I would recommend it to every hair stylist. UPDATE: now 7-8 months later my blowdryer is broken. I really loved this blowdryer but mine just stopped work and only blows cold air now. Very disappointing.
Worked great while it lasted, good for travel This hair dryer worked great while it lasted.  Only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel.  Otherwise, you are much better off getting something else
Dryer Great,,,, Conair, Not So Great I have no problems with the hair dryer itself, however, one can't register the warranty because the company's drop down menu does not list the year 2011. I sent Conair two emails regarding the 'Year' problem and neither was answered. When I finally was able to contact someone on the phone I was told that yes, the year was a problem, but the company didn't have any answer for fixing it, including not being able to take my information over the phone. Also told me that they are having problems with the company which handles their emails and none get answered. Perhaps I expected too much from Conair. Next time I will seek out another brand. Also feel that if one can not register a product for the warranty, then Amazon should think twice before dealing with that company.
Nice Hair dryer This hair dryer is decent.  It is quieter than my previous hair dryer, but I wish it was a little quieter, especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it's key features.  I love whatever material it is made of.  Whatever it is made from isn't a slick plastic, so it doesn't slip around in your hands or on the counter, which is nice.  I would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes, so if you need a light hair dryer, this is not for you, but it's not so heavy that I feel like I am getting a workout.  I also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers. So, it's not a bad hair dryer, but it's also not all that special.  I would recommend it to others if it is on an AWESOME sale, otherwise, try something else.
Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong ... Does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed. Mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high but it probably should be a single speed. The night light is nice to have in the bathroom. Overall I'm happy with it but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you.
Light weight dryer The dryer is very lightweight. However it did not have a serial number on it so I was not able to complete the warranty for it. I also tend to hit the power switch which accidently turns it off periodically; maybe I am just not used to the location of the switch yet on the handle.
Powerful and quiet for about a year, then loses power. Great powerful not too noisy dryer for about a year, then it loses power.  Even at this price, I expect a blow dryer to last longer than a year of home use by one person.
Very nice looking hair dryer and very sturdy Just because a hair dryer is pretty and sturdy does not mean I like it. It's very loud and very heavy. Also it's very powerful. I have natural curly hair and even with the diffuser it's too powerful and makes may hair frizz. I will be trying the Conair Curl Fusion Ionic<br />Ceramic Styler Hair Dryer because I heard it's better for curly hair and not as heavy or loud.
Mid heat setting is too cool I have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it, I like to use a diffuser, a low fan setting and a mid heat setting.  This hair dryer claims to have all of that, but the &#34;warm&#34; heat setting is so cool that I have to use &#34;hot&#34; if I ever want my hair to actually dry.  The &#34;hot&#34; setting is what it claims to be and can be downright scalp scalding.  I have no problem with the hot setting being that hot, I appreciate it when I'm straightening my hair, but the &#34;warm&#34; setting is insufficient for my needs.<br /><br />Other than that, the hair dryer is great, the attachments work well (the condenser doesn't spin like I've had happen on other hair dryers) the retractable cord doesn't have any problems, the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink.
Small & Lightweight. Not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers.<br />Small and lightweight.
Decent Price for Decent Amount of Use I have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years, and they worked well 75% during that time.  My hair is thick and slightly wavy, and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush.  The buttons moved easily, and the dryer's handle was comfortable to grip.<br /><br />The demise of these dryers was pretty much the same: fire the first time, sparks the second, which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here.  Also, the medium heat setting was a bit too hot, and it sucked in too much hair, requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal. I considered buying a third, but having generated sparks with the last two, I opted to purchase a different brand.  Overall, if you don't mind the potential electrical danger, it's a decent dryer for the price.
Three Stars Too bulky.
Way fast Very functional when it comes to keeping the clutter off the bathroom counter.  However I was disappointed that speed and temperature aren't controlled separately.  My hair gets dry very quickly, but ends up frizzy.
Great when it work, but does not last Pros: Nice design, gets the dryer off the counter, dryer works very well, and is lightweight.<br /><br />Cons: They don't last very long.  I've had 2 of these: First one lasted 27.5 months used an average of 1.5 times/day.  Second one only lasted 22 months with same use frequency.  I've had other blow dryers last 10+ years, so its annoying that this product does not last.  The fan blades inside the dryer are made of very thin plastic, and they eventually just disintegrate.<br /><br />Summary: I would be happy to pay more for a dryer that works, looks and functions as well, but lasts longer.
powerful but unwieldy don't like the  attachments, which is what I bought it for.  the brush is flimsy.  the handle design makes styling difficult.
Nice Dryer...Cord shorts (hazard) out from reel This IS actually a nice dryer... although annoying to get the cord back in and out at times.  I have had this for about 4 years.  However, it now has a short in the cord where it attaches to the reel.  This makes the dryer not come on.  I have to jiggle the cord and turn back on to get it to work.  For obviously fire hazard reasons, I unplug it after use, but will need to find a new dryer as it's simply not safe to keep using.  That being said, I guess for the price it's fine; it does work well until it fails.  Just DON'T pull the cord too far out else you will likely have the same problem as me.
OK for the price I can't say I am disappointed, but my last Conair was better.  However, it burnt out within a year, possibly because I dropped it, but this time I didn't want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available.  FYI--The one I had and bought on Amazon was:  Conair 213XP Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black<br /><br />I selected this one because I was so pleased with the last one.<br /><br />The color and functionality of this dryer are it's best features.  It probably makes a better &#34;travel&#34; dryer than anything.  It doesn't allow you to adjust the temp (cool, warm, hot), but it does have a cold shot button.  You can only choose High or Low speeds.  I totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase.  I did watch the video and it is what sold me, but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is.  Perhaps if you don't have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking.<br /><br />In my opinion, I don't think it is even close to salon performance.  It says it uses ion technology, but my last Conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz.  This gets the job done, It dries my hair pretty fast, but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me.  I will probably take the plunge and buy a higher-end hair dryer in the future, until then, this is OK and will get me through!
Not as good as mentioned. I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I was a little disappointed. It takes a little longer to dry instead of the faster way the review mentioned. It is also not as hot as my regular cheaper blower.
Three Stars It overheats on high after a little more than a minute of use - disappointing
Three Stars My mother uses ever day
Conair 1875 Watt Blow Dryer This blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the Revlon one I am replacing this with.  It dries my hair in a fair amount of time but I miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed.  The curved handle on this does not allow you to do this.  Other than that I like it and I like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer.
OK dryer, but doesn't dry any faster than non-ion dryers. I've read some reviews on here that this dryer is burning people's hair off.  Perhaps in an attempt to correct this, Revlon scaled back the heat output significantly.  I say this because my dryer doesn't seem to get nearly as hot as my old, non-ion dryer.  I used to have a small, folding travel dryer.  It burned out and I replaced it with this.  My hair doesn't dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology.  Also, my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one.  The wind power isn't as strong, either, even on the highest setting.  I kind of like this because my hair doesn't blow everywhere when I'm using my round brush.  But it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting.    Anyway, OK dryer.  Nothing to write home about.
Good but not WOW I've been using this hair dryer for over 3 months now. I wanted to wait to give any reviews till I used this for awhile and I must say that it hasn't scored any points for length of use. I thought maybe if I continued to use it, my hair would improve from being dry, but it hasn't.<br /><br />This dryer has a low and high speed setting, and low, medium and hot heat settings. The low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly! It packs a punch! After using all three heat settings, I found that medium works best although hot doesn't get as hot as most other dryers I've tried and those tend to actually burn the hair. There's also a cool shot feature that works great if you're using the hot setting and want an instant cool down.<br /><br />The attachments are an Airflow diffuser and an Airflow concentrator. Both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one. The concentrated one works good if you're using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot. The wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow, such as if you have really long hair.<br /><br />I thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair, but I haven't noticed any improvement over other standard (and less expensive) hair dryers. This is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why I waited over 3 months to submit a review.<br /><br />On the plus side, the filter hasn't clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all! This is amazing, since with other dryers I've used, it didn't take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter. This one also has a removable filter, but as of yet I haven't needed to clean it.<br /><br />This is also heavier than most dryers, so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it! It weighs under a pound, but compared to other dryers, it weighs about 1/3 more on average. This is also quieter than most dryers I've used. More time will tell on how durable it is, but the way this is constructed, I have no doubts that it will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has, but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have, it didn't score there. It remains just above average.you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it!

Diffuser is NOT included The description says a diffuser is included but it is not in the box.<br />Heavy for person with arthritis.<br />Not so quiet.
Three Stars Love it but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time!!!
Three Stars not as powerful as i would have liked.  dislike the on/off switch location.
Andis 80020 The first one I received was broken and had to be returned. The second arrived ok but the cord stopped retracting after 4mths and now I am back to having the same type of hairdryers I used to have.  Not impressed with the dryer at all.
Does the job...barely. So the bad news is that it doesn't get as hot as I would prefer.  It barely gets the job done and I'm a guy w/ short thinning hair.  I am sure ladies w/ thick, long, wet hair will require more time drying w/ this dryer.<br /><br />The +'s are that it's simple, compact, has a good working retractable cord & has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer.
Width Stretcher Unlike other stretchers, this one will only widen your shoes, not make them longer.  This isn't made clear in the description.  It's still well-made and I was creative enough to make it work, but if you're looking to stretch a shoe length-wise this probably isn't your best option!
I have always used Conair hair dryers but I am ... I have always used Conair hair dryers but I am not fond of this one at all. Sub-par for their usual quality.
Dry Hair This is okay, just not like the one I am use to using, it does the job, sort of but l must air dry my hair first or if I force dry it it becomes fuzzy and I dont like that, other wise it is ok. I was worth the price I guess.
Three Stars The needles were not log enough.  I RETURNED IT
Three Stars Never had a blow dryer tangle my hair and make it limp. It does get your hair dry slowly.
Good dryer. One problem. This is a fast, powerful hair dryer. I have medium length, medium thick hair and this little number works fast without over-drying. The problem? The plug is too loose in the socket. This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket. Of course, this leaves very little cord length for raising the dryer up to my head since the cord is already a bit short.
I like this dryer but it is a little bit larger ... I like this dryer but it is a little bit larger than I wanted.  Work really well and is not too loud.
Mostly ok I have curly hair & I use the hair dryer to straighten. The nozzle is too wide & the result is frizzy hair. They need to make a narrower nozzle for straightening!
Not as powerful as I thought it would be A fairly good hairdryer although not very powerful - but adequate for my purposes.  The first one I received didn't work at all and had to be returned.  This one works fine, but was a little difficult to install.  I love the night light - it is very bright, but one can always close the bathroom door if it's bothersome.  I would purchase this item again.
Three Stars I haven't had the chance to use it yet, but it seems average as far as quality.
Okay for travel, but miss my cheaper version. Miss the Cool Shot feature of my cheaper dryer, don't feel like it gets as hot either.
Great Price - Update: Sparks This hairdryer is quiet and light and dries my hair very quickly.  It has cut my drying time in half.  I love the long cord, too.    Update as of 2/26/15: This has been a great blow dryer for just over two years.  This morning it died though.  I was using it and it seemed like the cord was coming unplugged as the power seemed to be waning and then ramping up.  I checked the cord and it was securely in the socket.  This lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died.  I threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall.  WTF?  That was crazy.  I never expected to have sparks fly at my face this morning.  So, it was a great dryer until it almost blew up in my hand.  I still give it three stars as it was great for two years.
so good.. So far, so good ...
Blow dryer It works fine but I wish it had a hook on the handle so I could hang it up. Also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air.
Not as powerful as I hoped Not as strong as I hoped, not as compact as I thought it would be but it's better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in it's better days until it went bad.
... thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn鈥檛 bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I鈥檝e owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn鈥檛 completely soundless but it isn鈥檛 obnoxiously loud compared to others I鈥檝e owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn鈥檛 as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.
Just okay The hair dryer performance is very good.  The cord is a problem.  While the retractable cord is a great idea,  it is not long enough.  Often when I use it, it stalls because of the pulling on the cord at the plug outlet.
It's ok Operates like a very cheap hairdryer. We bought for our 10yr old daughter and it's fine for her. Takes longer to dry hair than most. We may just have a fluke...
wife didnt like it my wife has long hair and said this didn't dry it as well as her current hair dryer. However she will keep this for travelling.<br /><br />3/5 stars. Great design will retractable cord and folding handle. poor performance.
It's ok but... This is the first time that I've spent over $30 for a hair dryer. I was really looking forward to using this. I have had this hair dryer for 1 month, and I have to say that my biggest complaint is the nozzle attachment keeps falling off which is very aggravating.  Other than that I love how quick it dries my hair, and it does make my hair look more smoother.  I have thick wavy curly frizzy hair.
ok My previous Conair had more power, I really don't see how this is 1875 however it dries my hair just fine
T3 review The dryer works ok - nothing special but there was no registration card in the box so I called the manufacturer.  They said the warranty is void since Amazon is not an authorized dealer.  I would like to have known that. So far as I know what I received is a knock off of the real thing.  In addition there was no receipt in the box.
only high setting  works The lower setting does not work
The diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way ... A far cry from the Remington hairdryer I have had for 10 years but an acceptable backup.  The diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way too slow/low to dry as quickly as my previous dryer.  Another hairdryer to add to the collection bin.
good quality but returned this is a quality hair dryer, no doubt about that. But in my search to replace an old and cheap one, i didn't consider the size and weight of these newer, salon quality ones. Very impressed when i received it, but found it quite heavy and loud, due to a more powerful motor w/ multiple features. The mid-heat setting, which i was really looking forward to ( having only 'unbearably hot' on my prior dryer) was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm. maybe that's something to get used to, but didn't seem to dry my hair that fast. the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn't fit in my vanity drawer, and with no other storage option, had to find a model that fit.
Great hair dryer but won't last long This hair dryer is great: it's quiet, powerful, and has all of the functions I need. That said, I've purchased it 3 times in the last 5 years. It will not last long (6 mon. to 12 mon. maybe). This last one I bought has been the shortest lived and it is dying slowly. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to look for a more expensive model that will hopefully last longer than this one.
Not enough air flow I came on Amazon trusting the reviews that people would give this product. I bought it because it had high reviews and a great price. With a solid 4 star review, I expected a lot more from this dryer.<br /><br />The issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow. When you turn it on, it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor. Then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair. It doesn't have enough air force! I mean, it's a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow. But I expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given.<br /><br />On a plus side, it does have good heat.<br /><br />I also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy (the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction) but NO! Actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing. Wha??<br /><br />I guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for. But sometimes I have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot. This was not the case.<br /><br />Mostly, I really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product.<br /><br />Disappointed and I would NOT suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you're really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price.
Wall Mounted hair dryer I have had three of these hair dryers, and they last me about two years.  I like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall.
great until it stopped working after 4 months Loved the lightweight and compactible dryer until stopped working about 4 months after purchase date. It would stop in the middle of drying my hair and then go on and off every few seconds. Very annoying. I will not buy another.
LOUD & Cord Gets Stuck (Does Not Retract All the Way) I'm actually going to return this hair dryer. It's unfortunate (and I'm giving it 3 stars) because it dries my hair well (and my hair seems less frizzy than with other dryers), but it is simply too loud (I feel like using it too much will damage my hearing), and the cord keeps getting stuck (even when i try to help push it into the unit), which is frustrating. Overall, I'm bummed that this one didn't work out...
Nanoe Tech.. maybe I was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer's nanoe technology. But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue. So far, the biggest drawback is definitely the price.
Strange! The dryer has a very powerful motor, I'll give it that. Unlike some other reviewers, I found that the hot setting was more like a warm. Most significantly, though, it left my hair oily-er than usual! It basically left it limp. I'm confused as to the reason for this, but I'm sending it back, regardless.<br />(Despite hating the condition it left my hair in, it did dry it relatively fast.)
Pretty Nice Not a bad little hair dryer. Seems to work well. If I had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting, it's a bit windier than I would ideally want, and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be. But all in all, a nice dryer.
Lightweight but works well I purchased this unit when the more expensive hair dryer I had purchased from Staples online had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby....let alone an adult with curlers in her hair!<br />  this dryer is very lightweight and doesn't put out very hot air but it is sufficient to dry your hair (just takes a little longer) and the price was great.
Great for $32, not for $200 Really good dryer but now its seriously overpriced. Bought ours on Amazon in March for only $32. Totally worth every penny, however totally NOT worth $200. Not sure where the price increase came from.....
could be better I purchased this hair dryer to replace one my daughter borrowed from me.  I thought this was the same item,  but was sadly mistaken. My original blow dryer was also Conair Ion Shine 1875 watts, but it is a much better product, this one feels very plasticy and cheap, it does not have the power you would expect for 1875 watts either.<br /><br />All that being said for the cost of the dryer it works and I will keep it, but next time I will spend a few extra dollars for a higher quality hair dryer.
Motor Died after a year My girlfriend loved this dryer...except for the fact that the motor died after a year...super annoyed
Not very powerful but its cute! I have had alot of hair dryers over the years, i liked this one because it was pink and I could order it on Amazon Prime. However...the highest setting blows more like a medium/low setting which just erks me. If you have thin hair you probably won't mind but if you have thicker hair like myself this is just pain annoying!`
just ok. It's cheap, not that great. Not professional but it will work for probably  a year or two.  The buttons are not good because they are plastic sliders, and will probably break first.  I notice no anti frizz with this versus what I had with a professional one that broke before.
Three Stars Worked great while it lasted - which was less than a year.
I can't use it. This could be my own incorrect expectations, but when they say it diffuses it REALLY diffuses. I feel like I'm not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair, so I don't use it at all. It's well made and clearly does what it says, but since it's effectively useless to me three stars is the most I can do.
Three Stars I liked that it has a 3 heat (low, mid, high) settings, and great price.
Hair Dryer I like it, but I have trouble keeping the bonnet attached to the hose.
The hair dryer itself is great; but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible The hair dryer itself is great; but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible.  The fingers on the attachment are made of rubber and break off.
Could have been perfect..... I really wanted to love this hair dryer, and I do except for one thing: the placement of the control buttons is terrible! I constantly turn off the dryer and switch the heat settings with my hand while I'm drying my hair. It is pretty annoying.  Besides that, the dryer is great. It helps to smooth my hair and dries it quickly. It also looks really nice. Overall, it is okay, but I don't think I would have purchased it had I known about the problem with the control buttons.
wall hairdryer Good size, nice to be out of the way and on the wall. Unfortunately, it stopped working 9 months after I bought it. I was sent a replacement and hopefully, this one will work longer!
No cool shot in your description it said it has a cool shot.  This was the one thing that i was looking for, and it does not have it.  Disapointing.
Works Great....But I ordered two of these dryers. I had used them before and I trust their quality. But, when the product arrived, I found that there was no  plug on the end of the cord. These units are made to be hard-wired into the electrical system. I didn't see that clearly spelled out in the descriptive text when I was looking for the product. As such, instead of going thru the hassle of returning both of the dryers I went to Ace Hardware and purchased some plugs to put on the cords. Now I'm just hoping and praying the connections don't heat up and set the house on fire.<br /><br />But the dryers themselves work great!
Three Stars Doesn't blow as hard as I was hoping :(. With long, thick hair, it takes a while to dry
Three Stars Works well, but not as light and small as other travel dryers I have had.
Another typical hairdryer I have very fine hair and it is not &#34;thick&#34;, so when I go outside on a humid day, the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style I intended when I left the house. Static was a big issue, so when shopping for a blower with high wattage, high heat (yes, I want HOT) and high velocity, I found this one hoping it would meet the requirements. I found it to be like most of the drug-store blowers in my blower-graveyard in the closet, going to the next garage sale. I just did not meet the expectations, not enough blow, heat and I still had frizzy static hair. It works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don't want to damage, but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style. I did move on and purchased Onei MK-II for about $70 taking a really big chance. It blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations. So for fine hair users, it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types.
Does the job, but going to keep looking I was in the market for a new hair dryer after my previous one gave out after a few years.  I did considerable research, and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and the low price.<br /><br />This one is suitable, but I'm going to keep looking for a new one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It increased my drying time (I previously had an inexpensive Revlon)<br />- Even on the highest setting, the temperature does not get that hot<br />- It is a bit on the heavy side<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The retractable cord is great for storage
My hair seems limp after using.... I've had two hair dryers in the last 27 years so when I had to buy another this weekend I wondered what all of the ion technology stuff was all about...well...I'm not sure I love it. My hair is long and fine and I had to use three times the amount of root lifter to get my hair to do anything; pretty much it's just plastered to my head!     The other thing I did not like was that the buttons are right where my fingers go so I kept hitting them and changing the settings as I was drying.    A PLUS is that even though my other dryer was 1875 watts this dryer seems much more forceful and it dried my hair over all very quickly without getting super hot. I'm sure the dryer is much better for my hair than my old dryer, but I just can't take this limp hair!    I'll update in a few days, maybe it was just a bad weather day....
It's ok The product is ok, and does the job, but compared to other Infinity hair dryers by Conair, this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair. I do love the fact that it has a retractable cord.
this is a nice dryer but I saw NO change in the time ... this is a nice dryer but I saw NO change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use.<br />Bottom line... Not worth the $$$
Good design, but quality could be better. Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use.  Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better.  It was out of warranty, and because I took the case apart to check for the problem, they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it.  Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit so well where I had it hung, I went ahead and bought another one.  It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan.  No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway.
OK The Handle is too big for me also heavy but I like folding handle ,retractable  code and affordable price! So I gotta  say it's ok !
Three Stars it doesn't work when I plugged it in it didn't work how do I return it
moisturiezer I think this product is ok, but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer.  Peter Thomas Roth should start lowering his prices for his products.  I can buy more products cheaper than his from Kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least, allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up.....
It's Good, bud cheap It works fine, but it has a terrible build quality, it feels chinese. But it's a good buy for the price.
Not great...not bad Chose this dryer because of the good reviews. Has a few annoying features: double buttons (heat and speed) and hard not move both when one only needs to move one. Also not that strong and so doesn't dry very quickly. Finally, sometimes the concentrator falls off. However, it was not expenssive so you get what you pay for.
This is a nice hair dryer with all the options and attachments I ... I had a cord keeper for years.  This is a nice hair dryer with all the options and attachments I need.  It is a bit larger than my older version.  I will keep looking for one that is lighter weight and smaller.  I really, really liked my older one.
Three Stars Very short cord, was expecting much longer.
Good hair dryer, some annoyances I've had this hair dryer for about six months. I like the diffuser it comes with along with the different temperature options and high/medium. It does help my hair look and feel smooth and healthy. Cons: the blue light is SO annoying and bright. What is the point of it?? Also, the hair dryer is not quiet like other Andis I have owned; and about half the time when I turn the speed to Low it varies the whole time its on, switching from high to low, high to low, back and forth (not the switch, just the speed of the air). Very odd.
Loud!! We were using Japanese brand Hair Dryer before this but it broke so we had to get another one. I don't know it's all american brand or what but this thing is soooo loud!! I was watching video on my laptop in the next door and I could not hear the video even with max volume. It does dry the hair up real nice but it just really LOUD!! We were just so used to Japanese brand high quality quiet hair dryer, this thing is a monster. If you don't care about the loudness, go for it. It does work like it advertise. As a dryer works awesome!
It makes me a little nervous bc I have long hair and I am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer It works well. Makes my hair curly and dries it quickly. It makes me a little nervous bc I have long hair and I am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer.
Nice dryer...disappointing features Nice dryer, although heavy. Cord was no longer retractable after only 2 mos. of use. Disappointing to say the least as that was one of the reasons I chose this dryer in particular. Drat!
Three Stars little bit heavier than expected.
OK but not great blowdryer Adequate, not too loud, but only two temps and two speeds. Since I knew the specs before I purchased, I wasn't surprised, but I did expect the &#34;Hot&#34; setting to be warmer. The &#34;Warm&#34; is barely above cool.
Darker than expected, but still nice From the bottle and the rave reviews I expected a nice deep purple/maroon color, but the polish is thin, so unless you can get it on perfectly you need more coats, and this causes it to be extremely dark. It's still nice, but I feel like I have black nail polish on. In low light it even seems like it is black. I don't love it as much as some people must, because I don't think I would buy this again.
doubtful like its predecessor, this does make your lips a deeper color and a 'teensy weensy bit plumper, but i've been using it for 1 week now and have my doubts about 'maxiderm's' collagen boosting effect.  if my opinion changes, i'll update the review but as of now, i'd say save the 10 bucks and get original lip venom.  OKAY!!!  UPDATE!  IT WORKS!!!  after 2 weeks of two to three times a day application, my pout is definitely poutier...YAY!  also, i tested it on an 18 year old co-worker (i am 30) and it had immediate results.  hmmm, don't know why, but yes, great product, it WORKS!
not bad It works magic for my gf thats why I bought one for myself too. My hair is thick so it doesnt work as well as I expected but if you are medium or thin hair it is definitely the one for you
Pros: Saves room on the counter, compact size ... Pros:  Saves room on the counter, compact size, HI setting is strong.<br /><br />Cons:  It only lasted two years and one month.  Had to re-order one again today because we had already installed the metal panel on the wall and didn't want to have to take it off and repaint and redo it all.<br /><br />Hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer. We shall see...
DECENT HAIRDRYER decent hairdryer. It gets really hot. Doesn't have separate buttons for air level and heat level. Instead it has one heat setting. Only one button that toggles between off high and low. the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily. I use this on my daughters hair. We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.
So..so Shipment took a while to get to its destination.  I was expecting a professional mini dryer specially the air difussor... bummer.. this is just like the ones that i could purchase in any department store.
Takes twice as long to dry my hair with this model vs other Remington hair dryers :( I have multiple Remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite.  It is loud and heavy to hold.  It actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones I own.  Love the color, but thats about it.  The other two Remington hair dryers I own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz, etc... this one doesn't do any of that... it's just a normal, no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest, hottest setting :(  The motor doesn't seem as strong in this one.  Would not purchase in the future.
Decent product! Decent product, although, the air volume doesn't seem to be as good as other similar products like this that I have bought.  I do like that there is a place to hang the cord to get it off the counter.  It does do the job, so I am fairly pleased with it.
Compact but could be quieter I was surprised to find that the  item was not as quiet as claimed.  That was the feature I was looking for.
Nothing special After reading all the reviews, it seemed as if this dryer would perform well for my hair type. I have thick, coarse, Asian hair and a lot of it. This dryer is nothing special though. It's not that powerful, and nothing worth raving.<br /><br />Pro: Three heat settings (The fastest speed though is not that powerful)<br /><br />Con: Retractable feature makes the cord quite short.<br /><br />However, my roommate who has thin hair LOVES this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own.
Dries my thick, wavy hair quickly and thoroughly I've owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time. I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*
dries hair Serves its purpose. Wish the heat came out with more force so I wouldn't have to stay under so long.
Too large for my area Looked nice.  Didn't even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it.  Need to have dimensions in description.

Three Stars night light too bright
Prefer lighter hari dyers It is too heavy for me.  I gave it to my neice and ordered a T3 featherweight because it is lighter
Works for me as an easy styler Can dry and style my coarse hair quickly especially with the special straightener attachment without too much fuss and effort
So-So hair dryer found it to feel heavy,and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair .Does dry hair quickly is it's good feature
Three Stars Fine product
It does dry your hair well but has annoying features Overall this hairdryer does the job well; its 1875 and powerful will dry hair quickly.  I have two issues with this dryer:  1.  the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when I'm drying my hair; its really irritating and 2.  the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where I usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because I dont want the cool shot button on to I have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle.
Did not last 9 months of limited use. My old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use; I was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer. I looked for another one just like it but to no avail.  I found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find, I purchased 2. I no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days, (and my hair is shorter) SO I expected it to last longer than 9 months. Today when I turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when I went to turn off the unit, the on/off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area. I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit. Now I am apprehensive on using the second one I purchased. For 25.00 each, I would have expected it to last longer.<br /><br />As for drying my hair, it was a good hair dryer.
i liked it much.... until it stopped working (the nightlight still worked but the hair dryer would not turn on again) after a year of use. couldn't get through to anyone on the phone. finally had to return it and try another brand...
Three Stars Heavier and Bulkier than my previous blow dryer. Not impressed.
Disappointed I was disappointed with this blow dryer. After reading the good reviews about it, I thought it would be a safe purchase. Wrong. First: The hardware to mount it to the wall is flimsy and hard to work with. Tiny little screws. Second: it is very underpowered. The best thing about it is the nightlight. Bright enough so you don't have to turn another bathroom light on in the middle of the night. I did get 2 of them and they were on sale at the time so I kept them. I won't buy one of their products again.
Three Stars Low setting is to strong and to fast also the dryer is too heavy
Nice product The item was packaged well but we were missing the diffuser for some reason not sure what happened but package was received very quickly.
Three Stars Thanks to all
Impressed but short lived This was a an ok product. Stopped working after about 5 months of use
My favorite dryer, but it died after 8 mos. The dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with.  This was my favorite until it blew with normal use.  Suddenly smoke came out.  I turned it off, vacuumed the lint that wasn't very bad.  Flipped the red safety switch.  Nothing worked.  I'm really bummed.
Just okay/overpriced I had severely damaged hair due to coloring, highlighting and flatironing.  I saw that this blowdryer was supposed to dry hair faster and condition it as well with the trick ions .Very disappointed in this dryer for the money!! Not faster by any means, actually it blows slower and cooler and takes longer than my Sally's Beauty Supply brand which is far less money. Don't take the advertising bait, don't purchase this dryer ladies and gents.
Works well but very heavy and awkward to use. Have no problems with the performance, durability. Works as it should. That said, it is very, very heavy. Is like blow-drying your hair with a brick. Also, the switches are badly located. Often find myself accidentally shutting it off.
Three Stars Cord no longer retracts.
hair can get caught in plastic seam of dryer I have used this type of dryer to straighten my hair for thirty years. Usually, I purchase vidal sasoon, but found this one on clearance at wal-mart. It works well. However, you will get your long hair caught in plastic seam found on the front of the dryer. Very painful and annoying.  Sometimes you can gently get hair out without it breaking, but sometimes, your hair will get ripped out by the plastic seam. Bummer!
Broken timer knobs Good dryer worked fine. I had this dryer for about 2 years. Only downside is that the timer knob broke and the dryer won't work with out it. I would purchase again tho. For the money it did serve it's purpose.
Eh... Could be 5 star if it had more 'blow' to it Pros:  ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    Cons:  the 'blow' component isn't all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap (but that's probably partly why it's so light)  obnoxious color    This could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power. I purchased it because I was excited about the good reviews. It does a pretty-good job, but the problem is that the 'blow' action of it is really weak. To use it I have to use the funneling head attachment, but there is almost no airflow on the low setting. Because there isn't a very high volume of air running through the dryer, the air is also a bit hotter than I'd really like it to be and I worry about damaging my hair... I find that I need to cut my hair more frequently since I've purchased this blow drier. I'm going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer. It's ok for now, and if not for the ceramic heat I would have returned it, but I wouldn't get it again.
Good value but not tons of heat Works as described but not the strongest dryer we have had.  Good for the money but don't expect tons of heat.
Hair dryer It looks great on the wall, but just isn't very powerful. Takes much longer to dry my hair, wish I had known.
T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition EvolutionProfessional Iionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer I was not too happy with this hair dryer. It's a nice hair dryer but doesn't blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair. I have a Hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is. I would say it's a fairly good deal for the price. I gave $200 for my Hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer.I'm mainly using the T3 Bespoke hair dryer for a back up.
Dries fast, vibrates in your hand The one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which I don't like. It does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly.
The good: For the most part I bought this hair dryer because my last one finally died after about 5 years. I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it. In hindsight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.ight, I wish I would've splurged another 10 or 20 bucks for something nicer.
Does not blow hard enough for me. Does not blow hard enough for me. Bought a different brand and it works great!
Not amazed. I really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists.  I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!<br /><br />Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!
Three Stars VERY HEAVY - seems to work well but wouldn't recommend for travel.
Works as described Other reviews stated it was to hot.  Not for me. Gets warm but I could not call it hot.<br /><br />Recommend
Great power, Fast drying, but super tangly hair I have normal to fine long hair, and while this dryer has dramatically shortened my drying time, my biggest issue is that it turns my dried hair into a tangly mess. A hairbrush literally rips my hair out after drying. I haven't had this issue with a dryer before, and an at-home coconut oil treatment has helped the situation somewhat, so I've decided to keep the dryer until my next haircut to see if that alleviates the tangles. If not, I will probably buy a new dryer.
Nice product Not using is regularly but its serving the worth of the price. its is small and easy for carrying during the travel.
Andis Dryer I like the fact this dryer is light which is great however it is very loud and I have to use earplugs because of the noise level.  It does a great job drying and styling hair.  I have used this dryer in hotels before but never have I experienced a dryer that is this loud.
Needs a longer hose. The hose needs to be a little bit longer. Heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose.
Blow me away! Ended up being a little TOO powerful.
Three Stars Good dryer but the buttons aren't easy to move.
not good for people with arthritis or smaller hands this dryer works great, folds up nicely, the only thing is... the handle, it is to big around, and it is to smooth, I had a hard time hanging on to it.If it had some ridges that might have helped. And it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair.
Dryer works great but be careful with cord Dryer works great but be careful with cord. Last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord.
seems different then the one i had before i had this exact model for like 3 years. my husband bought this for me online bc it was finally dying on me. but this one...idk its not as powerful as my old one. and im literally in the bathroom ten minutes longer trying to get my hair dry.
It's fine if you don't need precision drying The good: powerful, fast drying that leaves hair feeling good.<br /><br />The bad: too much power on the low speed leaves lots of flyaways and substantially reduces control over the finished style.<br /><br />This hairdryer has a lot of power, which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly. The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer. As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &#34;high&#34; and would only work on &#34;low&#34;).
Too big to travel I had a small travel hair dryer that finally broke after many years of use. i looked on line for a similar one but the Conair was the only one that folded so I though it might be the same size. it was not. Great for home but too large for travel.
Not. It is not light weight, and does not blow dry hair fast. The only thing it has going for it is it's quieter than the one I have.<br />I was looking for a good lightweight blow dryer. It does not compare to the T3
Good dryer This is a good dryer, especially for travel use.  The only complaint that I have is that it is heavy to hold after a while.
Not so new I like the hairdryer, but am disappointed in the purchase. It was labeled as new, but when I got it I noticed that the filter already had quite a bit of lint buildup and there were little, cut hairs stuck to the velcro cord wrap. I got the feeling that maybe this item had been used in a salon. It looked pretty new, so perhaps it was used as a demo. The new description was therefore misleading.
Works amazingly well. Loudest dryer ever. I bought this little dryer from another vendor. Normally it takes me a good 40 minutes to get my hair mostly dry and I air dry the rest with quite a bit of frizz. This little hair dryer is very lightweight, comfortable to hold and dried my hair nearly complete after just 5 minutes with no frizz. I returned it.<br /><br />The problem is, this is literally the loudest hair dryer I have ever come across. Really loud. I felt like I had hearing issues for about 15 minutes afterward. Granted I have severe migraines and am super sensitive to noise. I love the job it did, I just wish it did it more quietly. I could not imaging turning this on while traveling, camping, staying at someone's house. Too bad
Three Stars Takes quite some time to dry longer hair.
Hair dryer I use this hair dryer every day and I don't feel as if it's doing a &#34;great&#34; drying job.  I previously had a Revlon mini which worked just great.  In any case, will continue to use this one until it dies.
It's ok It works but i always end up having a sore throat the next morning..<br /><br />maybe because i swallow some but hey  it works and cheap
Andis Hair Dryer Install was easy and quick, loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord.  night light is really bright, I mean REALLY BRIGHT.   I think it's quiet ( as in the lable)is because of the lower speed  of the blower  motor. I prefer more air moving. Dryer does a good job all in all.
Three Stars Cute but cheaply made.
Great while it lasted Loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds. Did what a dryer was suppose to do. However, it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly. From other reviews, I would say don't buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max.
The buttons are touched to easily when holding it The buttons are touched to easily when holding it. Also there should be 3 speeds on the air blowing.
okay It's a bit heavy and smells faintly of burning something, but overall it's fine. It's not so bad that i want to return it. I just wish it were lighter, I guess!
Average Dryer I had not purchased a hair dryer in 14 years; I was still using my Mary Kate & Ashley Olsen hair dryer from my youth.  Having worked at Ulta during college, I grew to love the Hot Tools products.  I was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other Hot Tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out.  On the day that my blow dryer finally died, I quickly purchased this model.  Sure, it has several speed and heat settings, but it's nothing special.  My itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion/ceramic/multi-function hair dryers of present day.  I don't think you're going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the T-3s and Chi's.  i think I could have spend about $15 less and still achieved the same look and quality.  I have very long and thick hair, and unfortunately, the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one I chose to use 14 years ago.
Three Stars Ok.... It really dosent get that hot.
Didn't work with an inverter or converter started smoking while ... Didn't work with an inverter or converter started smoking while abroad. But has a lot of power for a small dryer
Doesn't get hot enough This hairdryer is pretty but doesn't get hot enough to dry my medium length hair.  Keeping it but wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.
Hot setting should be Nuclear!!!  Watch out! I like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot, it's brain boiling!  Use with extreme caution!
Gave as a present, but she didn't like it I gave it as a Christmas present. It looks pretty nice, but she didn't like it and asked me to exchange it for something else. She liked the look of it, confirmed It is less noisy than normal hair dryers, but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair.
Blown away While looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me, I found this one. The price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one I'd just thrown away. I'd give it a higher review but I found the on/off switch to be in an awkard position. It is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money.
Design The Revlon works well enough.  It replaces  a Braun (?) machine that shorted out.  The Revlon is larger than I like but that is not a real problem.
Not what I expected This hair dryer did not deliver the turbo drying that I wanted.  It takes too long to dry my hair.
Ok It dries hair great. Wish I would have paid attention that you can't adjust the heat. You can only turn it on low or high.
Hair Dryer This dryer works fine, it does just what I wanted. The color is quite pink, and it's very small, almost like a toy. Smaller than I thought it would be. It would be really nice for a young girl. It will be great for traveling too. It serves the purpose for me and works fine.
Decent (according to my girlfriend) I bought this for my girlfriend after seeing it advertised on tv.  It sticks well to the mirror but there is a problem with the adjustable arm.  According to my girlfriend, her hair dryer is too heavy and pulls the arm down.  I told her to get a smaller hair dryer.  That didn't go over well.
It is quiet-er The main reason I bought this hair dryer 2 years age, it's because it was advertised as being quiet. (I can't stand noisy hair dryers) and although it's not as quiet as I expected, it is quieter than all of the other ones I've bought.  It's has great power, it's light, easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny.  2 Weeks ago it started to fail, I couldn't turn it off, so I'd just unplug it, but this morning it completely stopped working.  So over all, I think I did get my money's worth, because I blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min, so the price is really good vs. the quality. I even bought another one just now.  Hope this helps.
hair dryer This dryer was purchased to replace a like dryer.    I was extremely disappointed to find this product had no night light.
Works fine, I just wish there was a cool setting ... Works fine, I just wish there was a cool setting for those hot days you have to blow dry your hair. It also seems like it doesn't get as hot as my other hair dryer this size.
It's fine, nothing special. I'm surprised at all the fantastic reviews. It's fine, it works (so far, we'll see), but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer. It is not faster than any previous dryer I've used, my hair isn't softer or fancier. I do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button. So, it is what it is and comes with a fair price. Take it or leave it.
Not as good as the previous Tourmaline I have thin, fine hair and need to heat & rapidly cool the roots while back-brushing to get lift and fullness.  I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.
Three Stars It's ok.
too small this blowdryer does work and blows great but the only problem i have is its to small i will buy a new one and give this one to my 11yr old daughter
This works good, but not as good as my old one ... This works good, but not as good as my old one that I got at Walmart for $15.00.  It's a little heavy and somewhat bulky but I like the fact that the cord recoils inside.  It keeps it out of the way, but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet.  I have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does. I had no need for the attachements so I tossed them in the trash.  It works OK, nothing to write home about.
wow... that's a heck of a hairdryer Let me just say this. I love pink. My whole room used to be painted pink. I wear pink a lot. I love that this hairdryer is pink.    That being said, I think the color is the most redeeming quality for this thing. It's a hairdryer, people- not a car. Personally, I don't care about torque or rpm or whatever fancy gadgets it throws in.     It's still just a pink hairdryer. A really, really big pink hairdryer.    It's heavy, it's hefty (so you better have a strong grip) and it does NOT fold over. The cord retracts, but I repeat, it does NOT fold over.     It does have variable temps, which is nice I guess. It gets the job done- but so does my small hairdryer. And I don't think that one doubles as a weapon. and my arm doesn't hurt after using it.    There's some sort of black, pointy attachment for this thing. I don't know what it does. If you do, good for you! But ya know what? It's still a really big, really expensive, pink hairdryer.    and I love pink. and it gets the job done.
WALL MOUNTED HAIR DRYER I had ordered this product before and accidently ordered a smaller version of the one I wanted.  It mounted easily and works fine even tho I would prefer a stronger drying force.
Just Okay I was really excited about this hairdryer and it's retractable cord, but it really hasn't lived up to the original excitement. As a hairdryer, it's just okay. It's no better than the one I used before, but it does, of course, serve its purpose. Although the cord does retract, sometimes it doesn't retract all the way. Overall, it's not a bad dryer. I was just hoping for more.
Did not have all the functions of reg hand held ! Dogs to work as well as my hand held  Conair and doesn't have button to stop heat and just blow air .  Disappointed in the functions .  Steve allen
Too HOT, Literally This blow dryer has only two settings, high and low with a cold shot, The high setting is very,very hot, I'm assuming that is why it dries hair so quickly, don't hold it in the same place for too long, you could burn your scalp. I do like the light weight of this dryer and long cord.  I would like to have a dryer that you can have more control over the heat and output of air. I most likely will not spend 100.00 to replace this dryer with the same model.
Durability? I really like this hair dryer enough to buy a second one. The first one made a popping sound and quit so hopefully this one will do better.
very powerful I probably do not need all this power, but there is a low setting so that makes it better.  It fits my space very well
alright for a while came quick, work fine for about a week now won't suction or stick to any thing. my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him but now it won't, sad.
Cheap, but marginal at best... I had high hopes for this dryer based on the reviews, but it's marginal at best.  The heat setting is pretty weak, and if you have a ton of hair, forget about it.  For me, I'll keep using it, but my wife said she'd never be able to use this on a daily basis.
Does the job okay The unit does the job of drying hair just fine, but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable.
Three Stars Nice hair dryer but very heavy.
Fire hazard It shoots sparks fairly often. Kind of scary.
It's alright If you ask me this product doesn't work much different than the Redken Full Frame 07 Protective Volumizing Mousse.  The mousse works better than the lotion it never makes your hair flat not even in the back.  I even tried a reviewer's tips and it didn't make a difference. I have fine hair.  I'll continue to use it because it makes my hair soft.
Different than previous models I've owned 3 of these hair dryers now. They would break after a year or so, but given the low price and quality while it worked, I had no problem replacing it. This newer version is not as impressive. The eco options are great for the environment, but it takes twice as long to dry my hair. The heat is no where near even the middle option on previous versions. Might be great for those who don't need a quick dry and like the lower temperatures, but it was not what I am looking for.
It works, but do be aware that it says 3 MONTHS for MINIMAL effects. I've used this product for about 2 months, it did somewhat whiten my teeth and I had no side effects. I stopped using it only because I did not deem it necessary to continue to buy it as I was using a trial that came free on my Listerine. <br /> <br />Hairy tongue and all other side effects people have mentioned can be caused by regular use of mouthwashes containing oxidizing agents, such as peroxide, or astringent agents, such as witch hazel or menthol. Its an allergic reaction, don't blame the product.
Weighty Subject The John Frieda JF1 does all it says it will. Shiny hair with no static. Dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers. The overall look is very nice. Just one major problem...its very heavy. If you are in it for the long haul,as with long thick hair styling,you better be young and strong. I am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and I find it easier to just use the curling Iron on most days. If you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying.
Mounting defect The mounting screws that screw the base to the mounting plate are really tiny and flimsy. One of the two screws stripped its thread right away when it was being slightly tighten. It's a shame that a good product fails for something so simple.
Not bad Kind of heavy, cord sometimes doesn't roll up all the way, not very powerful but my hair is soft when using it.
Decent Dryer This Conair dryer is decent. The extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor, which can be convenient. Also the air only comes from out of the back, and not the front or the sides, and no matter what the setting is you'll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour. But, for the price, and if you can find some comfortable way to sit, it is worth it for those days when you don't have time to head to the hair salon.
Three Stars works well the only problem is the tip wont stay on
Good for the price I really didn't expect anything spectacular with this dryer,but i am satisfied with the product overall...the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged. I am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings. High is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments...the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place...all around the top of the hood, and then the airflow from the opening in the back. I can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem...if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15-20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one. Its ok for its price.
Three Stars Not very powerful and took me longer than usual to dry my hair.
Three Stars It came without instructions.  Works okay.  Nothing above average about it.
You get what you pay for... Fits a need, but not as nicely made as the model it replaced. The base is all molded plastic and is not really integrated with the hair dryer. What I mean is that there are two notches cut in to the plastic base and the hair dryer cord is run through the notches with some rubber grommets used to hold the cord in place.<br /><br />There are not a lot of alternative products to choose from and on the plus side it was relatively cheap and easy to install.
Not my favorite. Seems slow to blow. Works okay otherwise. Not a lot of power compared to my much less expensive dryer that lasted 6 years. I should have replaced it with the same one but went with reviews I saw on Amazon about this dryer. Live and learn.
Great for at home! Not very travel friendly.  I was hoping that it would fold up.. it doesn't.  It works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer.
Not bad, not great Product is light as advertised but does not seem as strong as it should be.  The first I received came apart as it was missing 2 screws, but Amazon was great and stood behind product and sent another out immediately.  That one is fine.  Love the T3 feather weight.
Good value but crummy dryer Good value but crummy dryer. Doesn't get very hot but it isn't too noisy...it was cheap so didn't have super high expectations.
Three Stars Good functionality but Too heavy!
Worked for almost a year. I bought this in late August 2012. I take very good care of my hair products and this barely lasted a year. Recently it has overheated very quickly and today it went out and started smoking from the inside and through the cord. Pretty disappointing that it didn't last more than a year but you get what you pay for.
Ok, but not great This hair dryer works pretty well, it is decent for the price, but not great.  Still leaves my hair fairly frizzy, regardless of what settings I choose.  That said it is not very expensive as far as hair dryers go, so it's probably on par for the price.
Retractable cord retracted for about a month This hair dryer does a very fine job of dryng my hair. However, I am not sure I have ever had a hand held dryer which did not. The reason I purchased this dryer was for its retractability. This feature worked great for about a month. Now, I cannot seem to get it to completely retract - maybe 5 inches at most. It is too bad I really liked the idea.
Underwhelmed, but not disappointed 3 stars - it's ok. I feel like this hair dryer is a little lacking in both heat and strength, but for the price I can't complain too much. I generally let me hair air dry or only use it for my bangs, so it does the job. If you're a serious blow dryer, go for something else, Personally, I'll go for a different model next time, but in the meantime, I'm fine with it.
LOUD! what?! I said it's Loud!!! Huh?? This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that's what your looking for. But it's heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!! Holy crap I'm going def
Works good, but doesn't last as long as it should This is the second one of these I've ordered. I used my old one for a while, although I thought it would last longer. I blow dry my hair a couple nights a weeks, and it started making a burning chemical smell about a year or 2 after I bought it. It does dry pretty fast however, so I ordered another one.
Not High Powered, Fine for the Price As a guy, I didn't think I would have much use for a hair dryer. But since I'm an adult now (self-diagnosed) my barber said that I should upgrade my haircut and hair product. This now requires me to dry my hair out of the shower. For me, this hair dryer works fine. I just need a quick dry in the morning before I put in hair stuff, so it's just fine for that. If you are a lady (or guy) with a lot of hair, this might not be the dryer for you. It's not super powerful, even on high, and is overall pretty cheap (look at the price.) It's nice if you just need something to get by and don't want to spend a lot of money.
Powerful but noisy It has plenty of power and dries well, but I had to return mine as it was so loud that it left my ears ringing.
Not as good as I hoped. A  holder piece  inside o f the holder  broke in a month so I am unable to hang it up anymore. Too late to ask for a replacementWill not purchase anotherfrom this maker..
Loud and Heavy Working Hair Dryer. I would not buy this again.  It works well and does its purpose.  My complaints are it is heavy and loud!
Doesnt really pack a punch The power is not great. It takes twice the time to dry my hair as with a standard hair dryer with a diffuser attachment
It is okay I like it but the blow dryer takes a great deal longer to dry my hair and I am unable to adjust the setting so it is on the lowest setting making ti take forever to dry my hair ..
It doesn't blow dry very hot air but I did buy it for a good price and it works Cheap blower dryer. It doesn't blow dry very hot air but I did buy it for a good price and it works. This is why I gave it 3 stars.
Three Stars Good!
Buyer Beware--Warranty Void If You Buy From Amazon This is an excellent hair dryer and a well-made product.  However, be advised:  The owner's manual/manufacturer's warranty included with the product--and the manufacturer's web site--both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from Amazon.
Good blow dryer, bad holder mechanism Great blow dryer, but does not hold tight in the holder, but rather loosely.  After using it just a short time the plastic piece that holds the hair dryer in place broke off, now it is disconnected and sitting in the basement not being used.
Too small to give enough power and may be dangerous I'm a dad so hair dryers are completely foreign to me.  Bought this for my daughter and when her mom saw it I got scolded as it's small enough that hair may be able to be sucked in causing some very bad times.    I would say it works.  She would say it doesn't work well enough.  3/5 stars as there are a few glaring issues if it's not only for a last resort.
Maybe look into better options The top doesn't move that well so it's a little crazy trying to get it adjusted on your clients head, knobs feel cheap also
It's just okay I thought it would have more power than it does. I do use it everyday so it is very durable and not cheap by any means
Eh... Not big on heat styling my hair anyway but I expected more. It's a subpar blow dryer at best. It'll dry your hair eventually but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair. Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me. I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.
Easy to install, sturdy after install and has been working OK for almost a month now No issues with light (some people mentioned it died).. been working OK for almost a month now.<br />Does the job and does it quite well.. quite powerful and dries hair well.. Now for the price its great! the reason I bought this particular one was because I used it at a hotel and liked the product..<br />Now the reason for 3 stars:<br />The quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior, feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months, the first one I had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so I returned it and got another piece from amazon (easy (and free) return I should say!). But the fact that its quite plastic-ey and the second one I received had the same dent (just smaller) so the finishing is not that great... but I should add it works and does what it should efficiently! I think i would give it 5 stars if it was $5 more expensive but was better quality/finishing..
Three Stars good product
Eh... I bought this hair dryer because i need one with a retractable cord. Otherwise, it is fairly heavy and kind of loud. Not the best or the worst, I have owned it for a while and it hasn't broken which is a plus.
This cord is REALLY long and a bit tough to manage. The dryer arrived as pictured......however, the cord is REALLY long and hard to manage.  It would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom.......Conair needs to shorten this cord by a good 12 inches.
It broke! I did love this hair dryer.  Ordered it in Jul 2013.  It is now March 2014 and only the slow speed works.  The other two don't. I know hair dryers are a somewhat disposable item.  But come on, didn't even last a year?
Nice Product Bought this for my wife before leaving on vacation. It works great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-light weight<br />-dries hair quickly<br />-folds up for easy packing in the luggage<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cord not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering :-)
Almost Perfect This really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things.  It doesn't get hot enough and it's missing a cold shot button.  The air flow is perfect, I love the different speeds and heat settings, how it feels, the lenth of the cord, etc... It just doesn't get hot enough to straighten/smooth the hair like my CHI did, even at its hottest setting.  I need to flat iron afterwards (my hair has a medium natural wave).  I love the way the Elchim is made, so I'm going to try different models to see if they have what I'm looking for.
Mediocre Rating I appreciate it's light weight; however the &#34;High&#34; speed is much too powerful and quite loud.  I've put it aside as a travel or emergency hair dryer.
Weak air flow, but silky hair. I bought this to replace my &#34;Conair Infinity Pro&#34; hairdryer. What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.
Three Stars Excelente.!
missing some controls I thought it should come with more separate low heat styling controls. The cord did not retract well into the base. Maybe should of been a little lighter in weight. still all in all worked well enough for the price.
Not what I expected. I'll be under there forever and when I get out my hair is still not dry. Maybe it's my hair but I'm nor 100% satisfied.
Three Stars not as strong as i would like it to be
just okay . . . I have this for awhile now and it get s the job done after a long while of blow drying. It doesn't get as hot as it supposed to and blows cool air when on hot. The colors are great and it is light weight but if you have thick hair i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better hair dryer.
Purchase a Andis Ceramis Ionic Styler Hair Dryer It does the job but I find it a little bit heavy to hold. For the rest it is OKAY.<br /><br />Joanne
It's Okay I received this little blow dryer for Christmas. My hair is long, thick and layered, and it has to be mostly dry for this to work. The attachments don't have any purpose than to clutter up the little, useless bag. When I was blow-drying my two sisters hair, it over heated and stopped working. It also gives off a burning smell when used on high.
Is this normal? Has anybody else had problem with the temperature?  The temperature fluctuates from hot to warm or kind of cool all by itself.  I feel like I have to wait for the temperature to get warmer and hope it stays that way for a while.  Is this normal?  It can get frustrating!  It has done this since I first bought the blow dryer.  I'm just wondering if that is what it's suppose to do.  Please get back with me!  Thank you.
Not as hot and powerful as I expected and somehow ... Not as hot and powerful as I expected and somehow it does not deliver any kind of expected shining usually produced by professional ceramic dryers...
okay Love it but it's so small. Can't wear rollers with it unless your willing to put in the time to stretch out the cap and pull your hair.
It is OK It can't be used as hot as I wished.  Seems that the engine would not bear the temperature.  Design is clean and I like it.
Three Stars Works well
Conair name sold me! SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel
Mediocre My husband uses the hairdryer a lot more than I do. He does not care for the way it works and the lack of settings. He is considering replacing it or removing it altogether.
Three Stars Space saver for sure. A bit loud and dryer opening is small.
I like the dryer - I know this will sound silly ... I like the dryer - I know this will sound silly but the color in the picture is the reason I chose this one but it is not HOT pink as it looks in the picture it is more like a Peto Bismol color. Other than that it is fine.
Three Stars The cord does not retract very well.
Three Stars Except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory
Retractable Cord The retractable cord is already stalling out on me and I just got the hair dryer.  It works great but don't expect miracles with the cord.
Piss poor attachment design The dryer itself works great , but the attachments don't stay on. I was spending more time picking the attachments up off the floor than drying my hair, really a piss poor design very frustrating
for the price and size of item works ok. for the price and  size of item works ok.
Three Stars Not as strong as the older built unit with same stock #, name, and specs.
Review It is not very powerful! Takes a while to blowdry, not as bad for men as for women.. But it hangs conveniently on the wall!
This hair dryer fool me just looking at it on the page This hair dryer is not adjustable and does not have enough heating power
Three Stars with one arm cut off due to and accident it does the job
Three Stars Good hair dryer but kinda heavy
You pay what it's worth. This is worth the money you pay for it. I have ethnic hair and I use pretty big hair rollers. Fitting them in is a little bit difficult and It takes me a really long time to get dry because of this reason. Besides that, I have had no problems with mine so far. However I tried my mother's new Bonnet hair dryer (different brand), which cost her 40 Dollars and it's totally worth the 10-20 extra dollars. I get dried so much faster too!
it works fine and I like the flat black finish I would give it a higher rating but the cord is just too short. Other than that, it works fine and I like the flat black finish.
Remington Hair Dryer I choose the dryer after reading about it in a fashion magazine. I was disappointed as it was not as hot and powerful as I had expected and the large size makes it rather unwieldly. I would have preferred something more compact. It definitley did not live up to its hype.
Dryers looks good its ok but you need to spend some more ... Dryers looks good its ok  but you need to spend some more time to get your hair dried.
Three Stars The only problem I have with this product is that the comb are not durable
New Dryer After a few years of use my old hair dryer died on me. So I got this one, its been working great so far. It has a few attachments with it to help you with different styles.
red dryer love Love this dryer.love that its red, not happy with the concentrater it did not fit on the end. Had to use an old one I had. But the andis dryer I had before is on its fourth year. I am a hair dresser so I use it a lot! The only reason I brought it home was because the vent on the front broke. So I can't use it on clients any more. I am sure I will enjoy this one if not I am sure u will hear about it
dry hair I liked the hairdryer, I wish it was a little more powerful, but it did get the job done and was easy to use
its okay Its not bad for the price
I liked it! It's a really good product to the price so cheap!
Three Stars its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good
Nothing special... I am an African American women with thick 4B/4C natural hair.  I bought this after reading some good reviews and I have to say it wasn't that great for me.  I thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn't have the blowing power I expected and didn't blow my hair out as straight as I am used to.  The heat settings were just ok also. I almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest I much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair.  The comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily.  Overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price.  I'm actually returning mine to get something better.
It is adequate. I do wish the prongs of ... It is adequate. I do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer. It kind of hurts our heads.

Three Stars its good
good timer and temp control but it is Not sturdy It drys fast, good timer and temp control but it is Not sturdy, it tilts everytime I use it.
good heat-weak blower i bought this for my daughter.. she said the heat is good, but the blower is weak. she has long thick hair and it wasn't doing the job... she plans on keeping it though-she is cutting her hair short and feels it will work fine on shorter hair.
TRUE TO ITS NAME It stays true to it's name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn't buy this if I have thicker hair.
just ok What I really hate is the strong bell when the timer is over..right in your ears, not fun at all.
Works well and the power is good. Not as heavy as I expected.  Works well and the power is good.
Functional Still works great but all the graphics came off within a week. If you have any product on your hands, expect the same results.
Three Stars Yea
Just needed parts to assemble!!! My wife liked it after they sent the necessary parts to assemble the hood. It may be a bit noisy but, it's okay.
Didn't like the buttons Didn't like the buttons. I've returned it. I'm giving 3 stars not 1 because I used to have Conair Hair Dryer and it was quite good.
but I like the power Doesn't seem to be hot enough, but I like the power!
Three Stars A little heavy on the hand but works well.
Three Stars Haven't received it yet but looks good on the positive reviews
Three Stars ok
Three Stars shiny hair less frizz... same drying time.
Larger and heavier than expected It is quite larger and heavier than I anticipated. I know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower, it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself.  Other than that it is a great hair dryer.
but it's easy to travel with and it work It most definitely is not this color or this size, but it's easy to travel with and it work.
Three Stars Not the best dryer I've ever used but, for the price, I can't complain.
Needsbetter instructions The Onei-II Ionique Hair Dryer does a really good job drying my hair.  The hair dryer is lightweight and powerful.  My only question that was not in with instructions, when would I use the &#34;Negative Ion&#34; setting or the &#34;Regular Ion&#34; setting.
I enjoyed using this at the beginning I enjoyed using this at the beginning.  After few months of use, it gets over hot easily and I have to stop and wait until it cools down.
it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out Can a blow dryer be too powerful?.. the answer is yes.. it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out.. resulting in frizz that I have to correct with a flat iron.. this was on low setting.. the high setting might as well be a jet engine. . I'm keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly.. one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do.
It's okay Not very compact for a travel device.
Nothing Special It was OK - liked the heaviness of it but was nothing more than just a drugstore blow dryer. Was hoping for  more of a difference due to the &#34;Tourmaline Ceramic&#34; name but nothing special or different than my last Conair blow dryer.
The problem I have with this product is that even ... The problem I have with this product is that even with a medium heat, the comb attachments melt. There is no warning on the manual whatsoever on what heat stand should be used in order to prevent the comb attachments from melting. I am grateful to Amazon for replacing my damaged items
Not too bad! Lacks essentiel qualities like adjustability of the height, temperature. Gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides.
The hose and bonnet does not stay connected. It ... The hose and bonnet  does not  stay connected  . It needs to have  way to lock it in place.
Drys your hsir , But! Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn't leave my hair smooth without frizz . It was also awkward to handle , the nozzle is long . I will go back to my old hair dryer !
... powerful as I would have hoped but it's not bad for a cheap guy Not as powerful as I would have hoped but it's not bad for a cheap guy.
Three Stars Diffuser could be bigger. But it is ok.
ok just ok
Like these for my rentals, but.. had one to quit on me although it's brand new I like the looks of these and have purchased a number of them for the rentals I manage as they mount on the wall. Out of about six I've bought, I have had one that I purchased in May 2015 to quit working, although it's had very little use. But, I am replacing it with the same type.
Three Stars Ok
It's not perfect. It's ok for the price.<br /><br />The plastic feels cheap, the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser, i feel as i may break it. The plug isn't the most secure either, seeming to fit loosely in the socket. Despite this, it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn't failed me yet after about 6 months of use. If you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick.
Three Stars Nice one.....
Three Stars It's a fine, but loud hairdryer. You can find a ceramic one in Kmart for a lower price.
I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot I love the convenience of not sitting in one spot. But the front part of my hair never dries but the back and sides dries in no time at all.
Three Stars Great blow dryer, just a little more heavy than I expected
Three Stars bulky and too noisy..
The only con is that it doesn't reach the back ... The only con is that it doesn't reach the back of my head. I'd have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while, and that cramps up my neck a lot :(
Only works on low power internationally. Worked well in Israel with adapter but only on low power despite changing the voltage. I thought I blew it out after only a few seconds on high power. Thankfully it worked on low a few minutes later when it cooled down. OverAll it did the job but def doesn't replace a real blow dryer.
Andis 30975 Wall Mounted Hair Dryer Normally I would have rated this item as very high. However of the 3 Hair Dryers purchased, one was defective. While the hair dyer aspect worked, the green light (bottom left side) did not. This defect was not apparent until the Hair Dryer was installed. I understood this to be a good hair dryer, but a defection like this does not look good. I will be thinking twice about any future purchases of this Hair Dryer (regarding product quality) as I can't afford to have a defective unit installed. I had to give my customer a 40% discount because of this. NOT GOOD. Thank you, David
But is definitely better than the ones you'd find a Walmart Just got this blow dryer.  It doesn't blow as hot as I expected it to heat up.  Just used it to style my hair.  But is definitely better than the ones you'd find a Walmart, etc...My hair is relaxed and tends to absorb a lot of water.  I Will post an update later with additional feedback...
Three Stars It's good, just what I wanted.
it didn't fit me, I WAS NOT TALL TO ... it didn't fit me , I WAS NOT TALL  TO FIT UNDER IT SO I HAD TO SIT ON A BIG CHAIR COUTON  TO FIT MY HEAD UNDER IT .  I HAD ONE BEFOR THAT THE NECK PART WENT UP OR DOWN AND I though this one did it too .
Three Stars The brush attachment doesn't work well through the hair
Three Stars needs an expensive transformer
... blow dryer was this exact model and I absolutely loved it. However My old blow dryer was this exact model and I absolutely loved it. However, the one that came in from Amazon for this purchase disappointed me as the retractable cord doesn't work.
Easy to mount to wall Not as powerful as some.this size.  Easy to mount to wall.  It does have a bright night light.
Everything okay but.....!! I found everything goes well except the plug. Why the left and right is opposite and I have to put the plug upside down for charging!!! Another flaw is the big noise.
I like it but its heavy It blow drys my hair pretty well. However, it is heavy. I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it. With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it's so heavy. I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers. Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn't as heavy.
