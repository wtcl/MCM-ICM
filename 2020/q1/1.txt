Failed in less than a year Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great.
What junk I'm amazed that people described this product as heavy. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all.
Loved it, then it died. Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!
Two Quit Working in Less than Two Months I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom.  Within two months, it went dead.  Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it.  Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked.
Disappointed It's hard for me to believe this is an Ionic conditioning hair dryer. It made my hair dry & frizzy. Nowhere on the dryer itself does it say it's an ionic dryer which made me think the listing is incorrect.
Cheap hair dryer with no power This hair dryer was a waste of money.<br /><br />The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.<br /><br />The warm setting is cool<br /><br />On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.<br /><br />Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS.
... tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer. Unfortunately this one was not very much ... I tried to replace my old Conair Dual Voltage Travel Smart hairdryer.  Unfortunately this one was not very much like the old one.  This one is bigger and bulker, weighs quite a bit more, does not come with a carrying case, and does not have a built-in loop with which to hang from a hook. Also, it is supposed to be two speed, but the low speed is too weak and delivers a stream of coolish air.  The high speed is too powerful and delivers an excessively hot stream of air.<br />What a disappointment!!!
Lasts no longer than an emery board, let alone a file. It took a single filing of ten nails to remove all of the abrasive material at the edges of the file. This product lasts no longer than an emery board and no where near as long as a regular metal file.
Sparks or clanks and dies. First one shot out sparks and died after about two years of usage, not a bad run but a frightening end.. I loved the size so had purchased a second &#34;back up&#34; soon after buying the original. Put the backup in service about six months ago and the blower on that one started sounding odd recently, Today it made a loud noise and a piece fell off inside. I'm about to shop for another brand..
It does blow hot air... ...but that is all the positive I can say about this. I bought one of these tonight at a local store to replace my dead Conair - folding handle, retractable cord were what sold me originally. However the cord is not long enough to get to the top of your head (it is half the length of my previous dryer). I couldn't find any info on how long it was supposed to be but I couldn't seem to get it out any further.     The switch is impossible to work with an arthritic thumb. You shouldn't have to use two hands to turn the thing on or off!    NOISE! WOW! Loud and irritating! This thing is going back tomorrow. Obviously not a Happy Camper with this purchase.
Extremely Noisy At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair.  So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer. This model highlighted being quiet as a feature.  Totally untrue. It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  I will not trust Revlon again.  Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing.
Broke after 6 mon - great while it lasted Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.
What a rip off Seemed to work OK at first although I didn't notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I'm used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn't figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!
NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! The description states there is a cool shot button, but there is NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! Amazon, PLEASE correct this misleading description. I wanted a small, no-heat air blower for medical purposes. This dryer seemed to be the closest thing. I'm returning it, but what a waste of time!
Doesn't get hot Returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best. I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.
not as advertised Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It's going back.
What a disappointment I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on.
will easily collapse on your head Flimsy, does not dry well, not adjustable, will easily collapse on your head.
Weak. Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn't have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry. Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.
Went completely dead in less than 12 months It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality.
Loud and Weak I just replaced my old Conair hair dryer. I like the 1875 models, as they are usually more powerful and work more quickly. I do not recommend this model, however. Although it is an 1875 power, it works like one of the smaller, less powerful models. And this one is terribly, terribly loud. I'm actually concerned that I might suffer hearing loss if I were to use this on a daily basis. I'll be returning this one.
Bespoke Hairdryer I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn't cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better.
Never blew hot air Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air. On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm. On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.<br /><br />When set to low heat, it didn't even pretend.
The unit burned after six months After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.
Old one worked great, new replacement keeps shorting out fuse We had our old Conair for years and loved it, so I got a replacement.  The new one keeps flipping the fuse switch in the switch box, so all the lights and electric go off in the bathroom, so I've had to stop using our master bathroom to dry my hair, which is ridiculous.  I'm getting rid of it and getting something that doesn't cause this many problems.  I tried to be a loyal customer, but this is how I'm repaid, by a crummy product.  We're done with Conair.
Get the Sunbeam/Oster instead I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It's bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don't latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.    The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you're one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I'll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!
DOA/POS Used once for 2 minutes on low heat. Second use was on high,  fan stopped almost immediately but the heating element stayed on. STINK to high heaven and extremely hot. Safety Plug did NOT trip off and neither did my GFCI. BEWARE: this is very dangerous! This piece of garbage going back tomorrow. Not even worth the 8.62 I spent.
Awful dryer! I purchased this dryer because of the features that it offered (retractable cord, folds for storage, multiple heat and power options) which would be great - if I could turn it on and off! As it is, I fight the controls which makes it impossible to use. And quiet? Not in my world! This thing is loud with a very high-pitched, screeching tone much like fingernails on a chalk board.    I'm returning this one. It's not worth the effort.
Awful Product I was initially pleased with this compact, inexpensive dryer.  But when I tried to switch it to 250 volts before traveling,  I found it is poorly designed, poorly documented, and dangerous.<br /><br />First, the documentation does not make it clear that you MUST switch it manually from 125 to 250 volts.  From the other reviews I can see that many people will assume it will switch automatically (like most laptops and cell phone chargers).  It will not.  These other users apparently did not flip this switch and reported that it gets hot and noisy when they use it at 250 volts. This is expected and is extremely dangerous.<br /><br />The switch is horrible.  It has no markings to point to the 125 or 250 volt setting, so I had to guess.  Only by trial and error (and the fact that it was supposed to be initially set to 125 volts), did I figure out which was which.<br /><br />I needed to use a screwdriver to turn the switch because, unlike most devices, a coin will not fit in the slot.  So unless I would have brought my toolbox with me on my trip, I could not switch it (even if I was aware that you need to do so).<br /><br />After turning the switch back and forth a couple of times it broke.<br /><br />I am a mechanical engineer and I decided to take it apart to see if the design really is as bad as it appears.  It is.  Switching the badly documented, badly designed switch is really necessary to change the circuit from 125 to 250 volts and avoid dangerous overvoltage and overheating.
T3  Bespoke Hair Dryer This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.
Plastic junk. The speed and heat setting buttons are ... Plastic junk.  The speed and heat setting buttons are flimsy and hard to operate. Also the smell of the motor is awful.  On most dryers the smell abates after a few uses.  This one smells as if it's burning.
Broke after 1 month! I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It's completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!
I hate this dryer! Very disappointed! This dryer puts out little air and is so lame compared to my old Chi! Also, please beware: This company does not recognize Amazon as a real company. They will not allow you to register the dryer even though it has all the registration information and numbers. The company is not user friendly ... and, unfortunately, neither is the appliance! Stay away from the T3!!!!
Retractable cord doesn't work We just received the package and opened it. My husband tried out the retractable cord and it doesn't retract. Waste of time and money, and shipping costs as well.
One Star horrible
Bad quality I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs! That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year! So dissapointing
Absolutely loved it. Until it quit working Absolutely loved it.  Until it quit working.  After six weeks the &#34;low&#34; setting was just a slight puff of wind.  The &#34;high&#34; setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly.  At the same time, the &#34;hot&#34; setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange.  So I started using the &#34;warm&#34; setting.  It's now completely worthless.
Worst hair dryer I have ever owned. I got so fed up with this dryer, I gave up on it after just a couple of months.  I now (very happily) own a [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer]], which, despite Amazon's title, does not have a folding handle.    This was my second hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient, but there are several things I really hate about it.  It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed.  You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this.  The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.  I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I prefer to use high heat and a slow speed, but that is not available on this cheap piece of junk.    I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this hair dryer.
Buyer Beware!!! I have always used relatively inexpensive hair dryers and have never had one break.  I splurged over $150 for a Bespoke Dryer and the thing burned out before I even had it for a year (and I don't even use it once daily).  It literally sets off the smoke alarm when I use it.  Had to throw it out.  What a total waste of money.  And forget any warranty - they don't stand by their product.
don't buy from amazon I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd's, books, etc. Don't buy this hairdryer from any discount supplier. I bought one, expected a genuine article, didn't get a manufacturer's warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn't get hot. I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away and now I'm on the hook for $100 plus. DO NOT BUY from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer. These dryers have a tendency after a couple of years to burn up. My last one shorted right at my vanity. Scary. Get the warranty. Please.
Didn't work for me Giving it one star because I haven't even been able to use it...it blew both fuses on my universal adapter.
Burned up in 8 months I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers.
not good, couldn't remain its heat. As with what the other 1* revers state this is not a good device at all. The problem I had with it however was not issues with quality of the overall products but more with the heat element! This thing couldn't heat up and when it got there it could not hold its temperature! I found this astounding considering! I sent this back on got this babyliss http://amzn.to/1FCEgBH It is of much higher quality!
Hair dryer burnt out in 9 months $100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not.
Second One Too!  Burnout Both Times This week, our second Andis wall mounted dryer burned out.  After our first failure, I always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis.  Prior to complete unit failure, the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair.  It would typically work again the next day.  The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months.  I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years.  We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light.  The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us.  I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer.  In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer.  Not good value.  Plus, I am sure I'll have to make new mounting holes and, patch and repaint over the old ones.
I plan to buy another in hopes that I just got a dud. Long story short.. I used it 4 times and it is now dead.<br />Cons: I bought it locally in late January, used it 4 times and now it has died.<br />When i first used it I heard something rolling around inside the unit while I was drying my hair.<br />I tried shaking it out but got nothing.  I was pretty much expecting it to not last long at this point.<br />I began to dry my hair today and again heard the sound, then a loud &#34;Clack&#34;. The unit quit and had a burning smell.<br />I shook it over the counter and 2 small pieces of red plastic shook out of the front. Nothing wrong on the outside so<br />must have either broke off inside or been left inside by sloppy workers.<br /><br />Pros:  I really wanted this machine to work for me so I will purchase a replacement and give it a second try, since it<br />seemed defective right out of the box (having something rolling around in it.)<br />I love the retractable cord.  It's only about 5 ft long so could have been longer but was adequate.<br />I just hate winding a cord around a machine.. it's messy.. the machine might still be hot etc.<br />Yes of course you have to hold the plug as you retract it or you'll get wacked.<br />It has a nice heft to it and seemed very solid.  Attachments stayed on when in use.<br />It moves a Lot of air thru it - more than the comparabe Remington D 3020 Volume and Shine hair dryer (which I also had on hand).<br />I was just begining to compare the 2 when the Conair bit the dust.<br />This was disappointing after having a hand held unit that worked for 36 years.
HORRIBLE QUALITY ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH......while I've used Yellow Bird Hair Dryers for years and have always loved them, their high quality has totally deteriorated.  The last two hair dryers have worked less than 2 months.  The first time it happened, I decided to give them a 2nd chance.  Now, this hair dryers has quit heating after only one month of use.<br /><br />Returning the item is expensive and time consuming......I'll just have to find another company and hair dryer.  Surely, there are others that will work for longer than 1-2 months.
Order a Bio Ionic instead I was going to order a T3 from Amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty I ordered a Bio Ionic Whisper Light from Amazon for $173.  Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one.  It has a 5 year warranty that WILL be honored.  If T3 wants to loose out on Amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty, let them.
Was great now two have failed in a year I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times.
Plug broke after 1 month The plug broke after one month.  Now I have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on, then it keeps turning off.  An electrician checked the electrical circuit, which is OK. It is definitely the plug on the hair dryer.  If I move it around in the outlet, the hair dryer will turn on and off and on...  It was a Christmas present I bought it early December, so now the return policy just ran out (missed it by a few days).<br /><br />Do NOT buy this hair dryer!!!!  Cheap piece of junk.
Not recommended for thick curly hair.. Unfortunately, my dryer is broken. When switched to 250, I can not move the heat level passed low. Also, the bristles to the brush arrived bent. I have thick Sicilian hair and the brush does not comb through my curls. I will be returning this product.
Horrible Hair Dryer I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush.  I have never been so disappointed in a salon quality hair dryer.  I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry.  I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now.  If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  I feel like I was duped.  The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways.  It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them.  Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.
Rubber fingertips on diffuser broke off immediately. I have thicker, curly hair, so my stylist recommended I get a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. I got this dryer 3 weeks ago, and have been using the diffuser attachment, and kept noticing little black things on the bathroom floor. Then I realized they were the rubber fingertips from the attachment. More than half of them are broken off. I don't use the attachment aggressively, and have not dropped it on the floor. I'm really disappointed it was such poor quality it didn't even last a month. Now I'll have to buy a new blow dryer, because without the diffuser attachment, it's useless to me. And buying a new attachment with shipping is as much as a new dryer. Bad job, Conair!!!
Feh I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one.
Not safe for use in the U.S. This thing had sparks coming out of it, so I called Panasonic and they said that these were made for use in Japan. They say 100Volts on them. Look at all your other hair dyers and electrical appliances. They usually say 120V or 125V.<br /><br />I've copied and pasted this from a blog where someone asked if you can use Japanese appliances in the U.S.: &#34;Can you use Japanse appliances in the US?<br />I am an electrical engineer. My expert opinion is I would stay away from using any appliance that generates heat...such as a hairdryer (as previously mentioned) or a kotatsu or a boiler for tea water...unless you know what you are doing!!<br /><br />Japan's electrical system is roughly the same as the US's. However, the US's voltage is 120Vac RMS (60Hz)while Japan's is 100Vac RMS (50 or 60Hz depending on region).<br /><br />So, any heat generating device from Japan that is used in the US will get 20% hotter than it's design intended. The risk is damage to the device and/or fire...or injury of a person. Please be careful!!<br /><br />That being said, you could use a transformer for such devices if you really must have them. But, heat generating devices are usually pretty high wattage...meaning you'd need some pretty hefty transformers to do the job.&#34;<br /><br />We do have another of these dryers that's a slightly different model that hasn't sparked, but knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy another.<br /><br />I've put a link below to a similar dryer that's Conair brand that we've bought before and which is what I'm replacing this unit with. There may be other brands; just look for hair straightening dryer or something like that.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME2YWG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Should be recalled This is the first 1 star review I have ever written. This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing. But this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled.
it sucks! I just bought this dryer today after my other Conair stopped working.  It takes SOOOOOOO LONG for me to dry my hair now...i can barely even feel it!  It messes up my hair more than my other one did.  As for helping my hair......yeah right.  Same ole frizzies as always.  I'm going to try and take it back.
Unusable hair dryer This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It's basically useless.
Do Not Buy!!!! A few months after purchasing, the HIGH setting became LOW and the dryer began shooting sparks out of it. This dryer is a fire hazard and does not function properly. Purchase at your own risk.
Very Poor Product I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  <br />It was very difficult to put back into its case.  <br />I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.
Worst Quality Product - EVER! I've had two.  First one quit working in 2 months.  Replacement ALSO quit working after 3 months.  I still haven't gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for processing.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time & expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You'll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.  The second one in mid-Marchlay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.   The second one in mid-March
Poor wall mount system I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day.
Way too small in size This thing is way to small to be useful. If it were a portable, perhaps, but this is a wall mount! It's like a mini hand dryer. Returned it immediately after receiving it.
Fowl smelling and burns skin I have been using this conditioner for years including a few bottles I've purchased from Amazon and directly from Bumble and Bumble. The last bottle I got from amazon smelled like nail polish and burned my skin. Clearly a counterfeit version has ended up in their supply chain.
Horrible Noise I don't personally use this unit, but my girlfriend does every morning, and it causes a huge degradation of my quality of life in the mornings.  It initially doesn't sound all that loud, but over time the high pitch squeal that it makes will start to drive you nuts.  I don't think she necessarily hears it as the sound exits through the back of the unit away from her, and I bear the brunt of the unpleasant noise.   Anyway I cannot recommend having one of these in your home if you live with other people.  I figured it's worth warning other people, so I made a quick stop to comment before shopping for a replacement so I can get back to relaxed mornings.
Don't waste your $ This dryer was purchased in August 2010 and the contriol button became stuck in October2011 and the company won't fix or replace. This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least. Called company and got no help at all. Will not buy Jerdon products again.
Not authorized - you'll be taking a chance I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you're taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it.
If you want your cord retractable dont buy it. I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....
Try a different dryer I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.  On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  I used this once a day almost every day.  I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.
Didn't last two months I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out. Due to a glitch in Amazon's computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance. Won't buy this item again, and probably won't buy anything like this from Amazon again.
Hoy recib&iacute; el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo ... Hoy recib铆 el paquete en Venezuela, es un regalo para mi esposa. En el momento de usarlo el producto no funcion贸. Es muy lamentable para m铆 encontrarme con esta situaci贸n. Por favor solicito que se resuelva mi problema. Gracias<br />Today I received the package in Venezuela, is a gift for my wife. At the time of using the product did not work. It is very unfortunate for me to meet this situation. Please I request that my problem is resolved. Thank you
Awful It melted the first time I used it in Europe despite being on the right setting. Complete waste of money.
Lame This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.<br />Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.
Use at your own risk... I have had a similar experience as many other reviewers. This hair dryer has worked for me for about a year now. However, I have always noticed it would spark while I was using it. I cleaned out the back where dust had collected thinking that this may be the problem. This did not stop any of the sparks. Now, I have noticed that I've smelled my own hair burning! Besides all of these problems, this hair dryer is labeled as a &#34;frizz control&#34; dryer. That couldn't be any further from the truth. I have never had a hair dryer cause more frizz than this one. Don't go for this cheap dryer. Spend a little money and save your hair.
We are men here. I was excited the first time I used this razor because it shaves so close.<br />By the end of the day my throat and neck area was extremely irritated and I had hundreds of ingrown hairs.<br />Thanks for the extremely close shave!<br />I was so embarrassed when I went to my girlfriend's house that night.<br />I like my face to be clean and smooth but this is just too close of a shave.<br />Also I must note that the blade gets worn down very easily and gets clogged with shaving cream/hair.
I actually liked it during that period of time I used this for six months.  I actually liked it during that period of time.  BUT after using it once a day during that time period, it burst into flames and practically exploded while I was using it.  Word to the wise - if your hair dryer starts to smell like garlic DON'T USE IT.  Incredibly dangerous.
One Star So heavy I felt like I was lifting weights. This went back the same day.
After using this dryer my hair feels flat, lifeless, dry and flyaway After using the dryer twice my hair feels dry, lifeless, flat and flyaway. Maybe its the &#34;ionizing&#34; function of the dryer, but it really did a number on my hair. I've been using Conair dryers for years and years, and when my last hair dryer died I bought another Conair, thinking I'd get the same great dryer. In terms of the dryer itself, it is heavy, difficult to hold, and the cord is too short (especially if you have long hair and attempt to style using a brush). Due to the weight and the oddly shaped handle, I found it very awkward to use. The buttons that control the heat/speed are also located in an inconvenient spot on the handle, and they are sharp on the edges, which makes using the dyer even more uncomfortable. Unless you want your hair to be a lifeless dried-out mess, stay away from this dryer.
heating element stopped working in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  Only blow cold air.  What a rip off, i have another professional dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  DO not buy this one.
Nothing special.. I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.
Worked for 3 months! This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I've had.  The first two were great--worked for years.  I bought this one on June 10, 2011.  It lasted until September 8, 2011. It's too late to return it now of course.  So I'm out the money and out of a hair dryer.  Very disappointed!
Junk! It died after a year of moderate use. It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, whatever. The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that.
Oh how bad this dryer is ....let me count the ways! It's too heavy, it wiggles when you dry because of the folding handle, the retractable cord is too short, it's noisy, the buttons are insanely hard to turn on, the cool shot button is too easily pushed by mistake and it's toooooooo heavy!  When you have long hair you feel like you have been lifting weights with one arm for 20 minutes. Ouchie...... DO NOT BUY IT!  The people are Revlon need to go back to the drawing board with this one.
Meh. Not that great and only lasted two years... Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty.
Only lasted 2 months! We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter's bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week.  She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star.
too powerful Low speed is not very low.  It blows away my hair.  Had to go back to old hair dryer.  Very disappointed.
DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER. I have very ... DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER.  I have very thick, strong, long hair, and this dryer BURNED OFF MY HAIR.  It is way too powerful and gets way way way too hot. I now have a giant chuck out my hair on one side. It also burned the plastic tips of my round brush. Disaster.
Dissapointing Low quality hair dryer I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.
do not buy The motor died after a year of very light use. (2-3x/month). It was a very poor value for the $80 I paid in Sept 2013.<br /><br />I wasn't very impressed even while it was functioning. &#34;Blowout&#34; styling results were not as good as I get with my drugstore cheapie; hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer; poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on/off, high/low by the palm of my hand while I was trying to dry my hair. (Maybe I gripped it funny, but it did annoy me every time I used it)
Dangerous Self Destruction Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer.
Bonnet will not last I thought it worked great the few times I used it but I should have heeded what others wrote here.  The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.
Good dryer but horrible bonnet The bonnet is very flimsy and doesn't last long.  Too bad as the dryer is very good and compact.  If they make one with a decent bonnet, I'm there but this lasted about 6 uses and the bonnet broke off.
ALMOST CAUSED A FIRE!!!! I like this dryer.  It's pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and I like that it has three different heat levels but I find that warm isn't warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot.  So hot I can't use it when I dry my childrens' hair.  I use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair.  Cool shot works well and it's a good weight for a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I'm less than happy.  I've had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!  This is a huge problem.  I have changed my rating.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!
i SO wanted to like this :( but i don't. the biggest thing is that it just doesn't dry. i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing, but my hair comes out about as wet as if i'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes (which is to say, maybe 10 percent dry--not dripping, but definitely wet and not damp). there are other things i don't like about it, such as the hose doesn't fasten to the cap, just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything, which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn't fall out of the cap; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time. for now, i'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand. doesn't allow for much mobility, but it's way more effective at actually drying.
Not enough power Not hot enough or powerful enough to dry, or style, my fine hair.
Wish I read ALL of  the reviews before I bought it! I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself. I read the first few reviews at the time & everyone seemed to love it. Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out (that happened to me once on vacation!!).  Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts & blows out my hair, I have soft normal hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  While mine has never burned out or sparked, it does shoot out smoke now and then, but not often.  Stay away from this blow dryer.  It will ruin your hair.
I agree with Rosa. I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either.
PIECE OF JUNK This product is a nightmare! The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough. The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year's worth of use. I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair dryer{which is still working} and decided to deep six the piece of junk!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
caught fire while daughter was using it!!!!! Avoid this hair dyer!  It caught fire only after a couple of months use.
I am disappointed. Terrible....lasted only 6 months. Only used this like 1-3 times a week.
Broken and didn't work right out of box. When I received the dryer it was broken.  I was unable to change the speed of the dryer from high to low or use the burst of air.  The button was broken.  I returned the dryer.
Don't DO IT!! Step AWAY from this product Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion, and let's face it we're not all going to agree. I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review. That is until now. I can't stress enough how disappointed I am in this dryer. I work hard for my money so I thought long and hard before forking out $[...] for a dryer 11 months ago. When it first arrived I loved it. It did what it said it would, it dried my hair faster, it was quiet and lightweight. My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair and I thought of it as an investment. I purchased it on February 8, 2008. Today is January 27, 2009 and my dryer is BROKEN. It overheats and sparks. This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week). [...].     As if I'm going to give them any more of my hard earned money. No thank you Bespoke labs. I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it. Ask any hair stylist. My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less) I tried it, and frankly I preferred it. It dried my hair even faster than the T3. For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months. For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it.
garbage Garbage. Had it for a year, the cheap plastic fan is cracked and it's done.
Flames shooting Beware that after some use of this dryer, the cord loosens at its connection to the body of the dryer.  If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately.  I didn't.  I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer.  It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.<br /><br />When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.
Marketing gimmick This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.<br /><br />Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service.
bought 2 of these, shipping back for a refund I really liked this dryer so much that I bought a second one.  The problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up.  if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund.  Seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue.
Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it Has no power.  Thought I would spend more and get a dryer that was better but it was not worth it.<br />Makes a horrible whine sound when I use it and takes a long time to dry my hair.
One Star Did not work in Italy
died after 4 months I used it once a day for the last four months and now it sounds like an airplane engine with hardly any air flowing out....stay away from conair!!
I would not recommend purchasing. Sadly the product broke the first month of use.  I would not recommend purchasing.
It is too loud. I googled quiet hair dryers ... It is too loud.  I googled quiet hair dryers and it came up.
Don't waste your $$$$$, Conair & Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product DON'T BUY THIS HAIR DRYER!!!!!  Buy $11 worth of lottery tickets, donate the $11 to charity, buy ice cream, anything else.... just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!!<br /><br />Honestly, I LOVED this little dryer for 6 weeks (just after the return period ended), now i have to throw it in the garbage!  The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.  Conair doesn't have to worry that anyone would be stupid enough to take them up on their warranty (and flushanother $20 down the toilet) and Amazon, must figure that most of the dryers will work long enough that it isn't their problem!
worst conditioner ever! This conditioner did soooo not live to my expectations! Fist of all it is not tick enough, it falls flat like pancake batter on your hand. Second you need a ton before you can start distributing it effectively on your hair. Third I've already used it three times and I really don't see any reduction in brassiness. I really don't understand why this conditioner is so expensive and most of all I don't understand how some people can give it good reviews!
3 down in a row! Great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months, the second died after about 5 blow drys! So listen to the other reviews, I didn't and now I have to buy another dryer. Update: Tried a third, it died after 3 or so blow drys. Clearly defective model, it can't handle it's own heat.
Isn't going to last a year I purchased this dryer in September of 2012. It is now April 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs. It still runs, but it powers down to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting. I expect it to quit all together soon.
I had three of these. They averaged about 6 months each or $42 (3x13.99) for 18 months of use. This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.
Quiet hair dryer wanted Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair.  Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers.  Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!<br />Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels.
Switch Failure and Sparks I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear.
Doesn't fit Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL Took a chance but this does not fit the Conair Folding Handle 1875-Watt Dryer / Model 124TL. The search continues! (And now I'm stuck with this since I just missed the return window!)
Nightlight Feature not ready for Prime Time I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn't want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.
One Star I love this hair dryer.
I No Longer Recommend It I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it.
Dont Do It! I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!
2 MONTHS AND IT IS JUNK I bought this unit about 2 months ago. I am retired so I do not use it every day. I have short hair so it has not seen hard duty. Today it began to run erratically. It also gave off a burning smell. My husband checked it out and found the fan motor is giving off heavy blue arcing. This is a piece of garbage and should be removed from the market place. I am dismayed that a name such as CONAIR would sell such junk.
You Get What You Pay for, I Guess. This dryer is compact and worked fine for the first two months. After that the motor started going really slowly and essentially it can only be used on the High setting now, which barely goes as fast as the Low setting used to. Of course, Amazon only allows refunds for the first month. A waste of money, since I like drying my hair on High. It hasn't completely died yet (6 months later), but I'm not optimistic. Also, I took this to Europe, since it's adaptable to both 125 and 250 volts, and it was extremely difficult to change the setting from one to the other. When I turned it on in England, after changing the voltage indicator, it shorted out our US/UK plug adapter and didn't work at all. So I'm not convinced that it actually does change between voltages.<br /><br />UPDATE: 12/18/14: It's dead, Jim. :-(
DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER! I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  After one year I am going back to my old one.  There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT.  It burned the top of my ear the other day.  The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.  Look for the Conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time.  Then only good thing about it is it travels well.
Flame thrower First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out.  From reviews and comments online this seems to be a constant theme.  But, since we had the holes on the wall, we gave it another try.  Second one, just one one year, and flames came out of the dryer and actuallly singed hair.  One year and one month so warranty doesn't matter.  On the other hand, I am not sure I want more burnt hair.  I will have to find some other solution to hair drying.  The portable dryers we have, some well over 20 years old, seem to work when called upon.  Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower.
None available. None available.
Rapid burnout While I really liked the dryer's performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I'm really disappointed that it's burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!) for under two weeks.   <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I've waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances) and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run.  Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer's quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines...
Ours caught fire too. After using it, I turned off the hair dryer and put it down.  The hair dryer came back on, caught fire and left a very bad smell in the house.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BROKE 2 DAYS AFTER 30 DAYS SO I CAN'T RETURN OR EXCHANGE (ON AMAZON) FOR A NEW ONE! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!<br />I did like the dryer while it lasted, LOVED THE COLOR, however to pay money for something to work for less than 30 days, it was shipped so I lost a few days there, is a joke.  This might be the best dryer, per stars and rating on Amazon, but for the money, go to the local CVS or Rite Aid where you can take it back and exchange the product when it breaks.  Oh well, sorry AMAZON PRIME you get &#34;0 STARS&#34; for this one too... sad because I buy almost everything with Prime.
Ruined My Hair This dryer ruined my hair!!! At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.
Worked well for awhile but a fire hazard? I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)
Overheating problem This is the second Revlon hair dryer I've purchased in the last four years and both times it had the same problem -- overheating where the cord enters the handle.  This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO.
Died an Early Death and No Return I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?
Fire hazard I had this hair dryer for less than 1 year. The other day it starting shorting out and then suddenly sparks starting flying out of the spot where the cord enters the handle of the dryer, melting part of the cord. Fortunately, nothing caught fire! I replaced the dryer with a non-Revlon product.
Nah This does not get hot enough to straighten your hair...takes forever to dry your hair. Not using it. It IS quiet though.
Blew the circuit breaker on 1st plug in! I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom! I had not even turned the hair dryer on! It had the hot, electric smell. I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored. I will not try this brand again.
did not work as i hoped i used the roller on a facail scar i have that i cover with makeup, it is not deep but im very self conscious of it. i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like (red and leathery) i would not advise using this on scars.
Lasted exactly one year Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one.
1600W setting did not work Purchased this item but was disappointed when the higher setting of 1600W did not work.  There was no noticable change between the 1200W setting and the 1600W setting.  Returned the dryer and will try another brand.
Avoid! It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!
ouch! painful design flaw This hair dryer sucks my hair into the back end and pulls hair right out of my head. I've had very long, very curly hair for 20 years and have used many hair dryers, and that has never happened before. I don't know how other dryers prevent this from happening, but they forgot to add that feature to this design. I've used it twice and am returning it.
RIP 9/25/2014 Lasted 9 months ... purchased December 14, 2013 .. Died September 25 2014.  What happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years?  This one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working.  Probably the 4th hair dryer I've bought my wife in 5 years ... I guess they are just a disposable item now.
Disappointed This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.
I did not like the design or the size so I sent it ... I did not like the design or the size so I sent it back. Pretty clunky-looking and too large for my dinky bathroom.
Here's a novel idea!! Read the reviews BEFORE ... Here's a novel idea!!  Read the reviews BEFORE you buy this bomb, no matter how cheap it is!!  After a few short months, my Frizz Control little beauty decided to sputter and spew sparks and stink up the entire house because it's wiring had burned out completely.  I'm just very thankful that my hair didn't catch on fire!!!  Oh well....it DID last a full three or four months~~
One Star Hair dyer stopped working within one month.  Not reliable!!
Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk Purchased to replace an older Conair 1875.  The GFCI plug on this unit failed after 45 days of normal use.<br /><br />In the future I will look for a dryer with a UL safety listing.<br /><br />Too bad Conair is diluting their brand with this junk.
Pure JUNK - not the real SP62 When I bought this, a real SP62 was shown in the picture. What I received is the one now shown in a replacement picture. It is narrower, with several fewer blades than a real SP62 and does not function nearly as well. Don't wast your money on this piece of junk, it makes the shaver not worth using.
Very disappointed! I bought this and it broke the second time I used it!  I do not use my blow dryer often, so when I finally used it again the second time, it made a very loud noise and then would not power on again
T3 says that amazon not authorized dealer I was very angry to hear that the T3 dryer I purchased is not covered under warranty because I purchased it through amazon. T3 charges $14.95 to repair but wanted to charge me $54.95 because I purchased from amazon. Do not purchase if you care about the warranty, and you may need it as my dryer stopped working about 16 months.
Horrible Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!<br />Would NOT recommend
Sending it back. Blows too hard on high. ... Sending it back.  Blows too hard on high....needs another speed besides low.
Broke after TWO uses I bought this for my mum and myself for Christmas... Didn't even last until the New Year and broke after two lousy uses. Biggest waste of $250 I've ever spent
6' coil cord does not re-coil I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.
Defective switch on the product. When I first received this I absolutely loved it.  Great power, the cord was sturdy and extra long, and it worked really well.  However, I am returning it for a refund, because one month after getting it, the &#34;hi - lo&#34; switch stopped working and it would only work on &#34;high&#34;.  I thought I could live with that but this morning when I was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it.  So I don't know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective, or if it is something that happens often with this model.  I was really disappointed though because I was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to.
My hair is falling out from this dryer! I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it.  Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower.  Please stay away from this dryer!  I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me.
One Star Extremely heavy and noisy.  returned
Rate it Zero Stars WAY TOO LOUD. Cord keeper is a nice touch but returned it to prevent hearing loss. Going back to using a hair band for the cord.
Worst experience!!!! The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!
item arrived obviously used this dryer arrived in an &#34;icky&#34; plastic bag inside the 'banged up' product box.  The cord was unwrapped and stuffed willy-nilly inside the bag.  The dryer had scratches and smudges on it.  It had obviously been used and returned.  There was no instruction manual included, either.  The dryer may be a good dryer but I didn't want to touch an obviously used personal item.  I am just appalled that such a product was sent to a customer.  Very disappointed.
hand grip gets too hot The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  Not like toasty warm - HOT!    It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  Don't bother.
Don't buy this dryer This dryer conked out after I had it only four months. Don't buy it.
Not for daily use. Received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4-6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday....if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you. It would stop half way through drying (and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair) and I would have to let it cool off before it would restart. Glad I never mounted it.
Zero Stars--Worst Dryer I've Ever Purchased My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We'd give it zero stars if that was possible.
Design Flaw. Save your cash The Heat guard attachment constantly pops off & there's nothing you can do about it. Don't waste your money
Dies after a month use! I was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use. Lucikly we have not any injuries!!!
THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER THE WORST HAIR DRYER EVER!!!!! I bough just 6 months ago and it started to have a weird noise and was not working well and the next time I tried to use it the cable exploded in FIRE, burned my hand and almost caused a fire!!!!!!
quite disappointed I bought this dryer being excited about the compact size and the 1875W.  In using it for the last couple of months, the force of air flow has weakened substantially to the point where I need to purchase another dryer. My obvious choice will NOT be this one.  It appears to have a plastic fan which may limit its longevity.  Also, the wide opening on the blower end makes it harder to focus on a particular area making it difficult to control what section of hair is styled and what's not. In the past, the dryers I have purchased lasted at least a couple of years.  This one was a great disappointment!
Dissappointed Ordered it for my wife, but the bonnet was too small so she had to return it. The alternate brand worked fine.
Voluminous? I think not. Lumpy clumpy crap...threw it away and went to CVS to get my usual brand. Waste of money. Does not do what it says.
Piece of junk. I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn't use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  And it constantly cuts off - this started on the second use so the vent could not have been clogged enough to cause this.  Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  I am definitely going to try to return mine to the store...it really sucks!!!
It was like a torch I have had this dryer for almost 2 years.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Today, a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire.  It was like a torch.  This is so hazardous!
What is all the fuss about?  This dryer sucks! I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.
Good thing it is inexpensive This item died after maybe the 10th time i used it. Good thing it is inexpensive. Save your money and dont buy this, keep looking.
One Star ordered purple, got red/pink. plus my hair get caught in the intake
Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer The dryer works great. The only problem is the hose won't stay on, it falls off when using it on my clients.
MORE cheap Chinese junk This unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound.<br />Despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap Chinese junk I have accumulated over the years<br />It almost made it to it's second birthday. Pitiful<br />I purchased a Panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement<br />It is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics
Don't buy this hairdryer Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere.  What a piece of junk.  Just stopped working one day.  Would'nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won't get them back.  The retractable cord worked when it felt like it.  Don't waste your money on this one.
Not Reliable I purchased this hairdryer four months ago, and the heating element has already broken. I generally fold it up when I store it, and one day while I was opening it to use it I heard a strange metallic pop. Apparently, that was the heating element breaking. It's now pretty useless; it will only blow cold air (just in time for winter, I might add).<br /><br />As an aside, this is the second Revlon hairdryer I've bought this year after having a hairdryer of another brand for a few years. I'm beginning to think that the brand itself is not reliable--or at least the lower end ones aren't.
BUYER BEWARE! I paid around 68 bucks for this a year ago. It never worked right. The front would get scalding hot and the back would stay cool and it was very loud. I used it maybe three times, four at the most and hated it. The fourth or fifth time I went to use it, it made a pop noise and then nothing. It never worked again. I cannot find anyone to fix it or replace it.  Of course, it crapped out after the warranty expired. DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER! It is a total hunk of junk. It still looks brand new, but its just a giant paper weight now.
Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased Worst blow dryer I have ever purchased.  The attachments do not slide on well, it does not dry my hair well, and the bristles on the brush aren't stiff enough.  Unfortunately I missed my window to return the item. I'll have to buy another brand and will just keep this one in the garage if I ever need to blow something dry.  At least it wasn't very expensive.
Can I give a zero rating? This rating is not for the item itself, coz it never worked. I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!
Cheap Knock-off, Don't buy! The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.
Do not buy this dryer! After using it for ... Do not buy this dryer!  After using it for less than one week, the handle would become so incredibly hot I could barely hold on to it.  I noticed that the protective covering had started to dimple and come apart. I continued using it being very careful where I put my hand on the handle. Now, after less than one month, it quit working all together. It shut off after smelling very hot and will not turn back on.  Junk!
I don't remember why I sent this back, but ... I don't remember why I sent this back, but I think it was because it did not fold up closely enough. ML
Dont Even Waste Your Money! I thought this dryer would be perfect; compact, not clunky, and easy to travel with. That's really the only thing this dryer is good for, to travel with. All the main functions, useless.When I had the bonnet on, dare I move an inch and that hose would fly right off! AND the highest heat settings was not hot at all. I painfully sat there with the bonnet on and putting the hose back on about a million times, to only come out with 30% dry hair after 30 minutes worth of sitting. This product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it. I will be returning..
I tried to like this hair dryer. I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!
Jerdon Wall Mount This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.
Sent wrong product - picture is incorrect I ordered the product pictured (Andis 1600W wall mount hair dryer) to replace a similar unit that I have been very happy with.  I was sent a different product that does not match the pictured product and has multiple cords protruding from the base and is unusable to me.  Amazon's rules are that it has to be returned unopened and I ripped the packaging before I realized the wrong product was sent.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.
Not worth the money. I bought this hair dryer when I decided to replace my still working, but not doing the best job, Conair. I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I'll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA.
Burned Out in Less Than 6 Uses!!! I had the hair dryer stored away to use when the remodeling was done in my bathroom i would say at least 8 months. I did not even use it 6 times and it just died. I was heart broken. Had i known i would not have stored it away, I would have used it right away. :(
Disappointing I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job.
hair dryer This product should have come with a warning.  Even on the LOW setting, one can get a third degree burn from the heat.
This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it ... This is not the titanium nano portifino. If it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state. It overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly. I know this because I also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it's an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist. Disappointed
Don't buy this The first two did not work and were replaced by Amazon. The 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up - after turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Luckily, we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire!
Don't last any longer than a cheap Conair I purchased this blow dryer November 5, 2013. Today is October 14, 2014. The heating element died. I have not dropped or abused this dryer. I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer but I am disappointed. I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don't find a difference.
Exploded! I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it's very dangerous!
Piece of CRAP! DO NOT BUY! Lasted 1 Week!- Gets Hot and Quits in less then 3 minutes- needs to cool off then will work for another 3 minutes!<br />Aggravating and not worth  the time to order this product.
Warm is warmer than hot! I bought this hairdryer because my last Conair had finally conked out after about 15 years.  I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it.  I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting.  The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting.  Something is seriously wrong with that.  Also, the cord was very difficult to retract.  I can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time.  This convinced me that even though a retracting cord may be convenient, it is more trouble than it is worth.
Had to Return Them I ordered two.  The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  I didn't even try to plug in the second one.  It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn't work out.
waste of money, fraud The description of this item is not accurate. It doesn't specify that it won't fit most of the tubs. When I got it I saw that my tub is too high for it, but it was too late - they don't allow a return even if bench wasn't unpacked. Waste of money.
Not what I ordered This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong.
Junk Junk. Hard to clean and it took a long time to dry. Other retractable hair dryers can be had for about the same price. Started to get a rattling sound inside of it with a burnt smell. lasted under a year.
A total waste of money! The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don't even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!
shorted out after 5 months I would have given this product five stars at this time yesterday. Unfortunately, yesterday I heard a popping sound while using it, and it completely stopped working. Totally unacceptable.
terrible hairdryer The hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on, plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot, wont recomend it.
Unhappy customer The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.
One Star The dryer blows cold air on US settings! Worthless unless you're traveling abroad!
Never worked I turned it on and it only blew cold air, even when adjusting the settings. I didn't save my receipt or box. Be warned!!
One Star Died within 3 months of use every other day.
awful awful awful would give it a 0 if i could<br />bonnet had a hole in it, and the air just doesnt seem to get through. this is a cheap product--make the investment!
very disappointed!!!! very disappointed- i have bought this exact product about 5-6 times over the last 8 years- it was awesome- great heat great weight attractive-etc. but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket- and sparks- which is scary- i love the hair dyer itself- but the new design of the plug in is faulty- what can be done?????
Broke quickly Broke after using it for two weeks
Don't waste your money Don't waste your money, I was two inches away from a girl and nothing. I'm in college and even in class it did nothing, and I put it on right before class.
Do not buy from Maitri Mega Mall I received the item in time, however, it is defective - the hot air does not work, only blows cold air. I have to return it and buy another one. Very disappointed! Do not buy from Maitri Mega Mall.
Only Purchase from Authorized Retailer - Not Amazon!!! I did not purchase my dryer from Amazon - however after 2years it just stopped working.  Thank goodness I purchased from authorized retailer - I had no issues with the warranty process & received a replacement dryer from T3 (although it did take a couple weeks).  This is a great dryer, I am very happy with it's performance & the warranty process - I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer.  Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase. I would definitely recommend the product itself.
died after 6 months I used one of these for 6 years & it worked well. So when the first one died, I bought another. But after 6 months of normal use it died and I now need a third one. Will try a different brand this time!
This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have ... I don't understand the positive reviews. Maybe I got a melon? This didn't dry my hair any faster or better then my cheap $30 Revlon dryer and I have thin hair. It just made me sick with the plastic fumes it emitted. I returned this immediately.
burns!!!! I had this hair dryer for only 3 months before my hair started smoking and I got burns on my hands from the dryer. I will be emailing Revlon immediately. DO NOT BUY-DANGEROUS!!!!!
Not what we were inspecting... I bought this for my wife, my comments on the result of purchasing this product a year ago:<br /><br />This is not a good for drying, I don't know why the professional word is on the description, next time tell this is for home use, home result, totally different to result my wife get from beauty med level professional.<br /><br />I'm Disappointed with this purchasing, but the time to send this back and get money back.
Air Flow Not Powerful Ok - so I had this hair dryer for about 2 years?  Used it on and off.  It seems that they listened to their customers and installed something that cools it down in cycles AS it is drying your hair.. however - it's not powerful at all.  My hair is flat and it takes forever to dry.  I tried everything.. I started to think it was my hair products - but once I went back to my old hair dryer, my hair was fine.  A true waste...Tonight my husband pointed out the plug (where the prong meets the black plastic) is melting.  Garbage!
Sucks! Don't waste your money on this blow dryer - you will only be frustrated and end up with frizzy, over processed hair.  The brush attachment is awful and doesn't grip in your hair, you'll be brushing and brushing and get mediocre results.  I decided to give this a try after my trusty Conair shorted out - what a disappointment! Even after blow drying I would still need to flat iron in order to get out the frizz.  Will never buy this product again!
Keep looking, not worth your money! Silent?  Don't believe it. So high pitched it hurts my ears. And when it comes to blowing, and drying, mediocre at best. I threw it away.
I am very disappointed. I purchased this item less than 3 months ago. After using the product for about 4 weeks, I noticed that the handle got incredibly hot...too hot for me to hold without it burning my hand. Today, less than 12 weeks after purchasing, the hair dryer started smoking and completely shut down. Needless to say, I am very disappointed.
One Star Could never get the wattage adjusted -- cracked the handle before it was used.
Stopped working after 4 months! Purchased this product at the end of March as a result of positive reviews. It periodically shut off until finally this week it stopped working completely. After only 4 months, a hair dryer should not stop working. Definitely would not recommend.
Disappointed Very disappointed with this product. It is so heavy when I suction cupped it to my mirror, I thought my door to my medicine cabinet (where my mirror is located) was going to break off its hinges. Then, it falls off when I try to put my hair dryer in it. My dryer fell in the sink and broke. It also does not fit my Vidal Sassoon flat hair dryer. The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer. Last, it is very hard to store as it is so big and bulky. Not using it anymore. TOO INCONVENIENT!
Warning!!!  Fire may shoot out of cord/handle connection during use While my wife was using the Elchim Professional Type 2001 1500/1800W hair dryer to dry her hair, FLAMES - yes that's right flames, not sparks - shot out of the base of the handle at the point where the power cord enters.    This was totally unexpected since the wire and handle showed no visible signs of damage.  Thankfully, my wife was not injured.  However, please be aware that this may occur with this dryer and could cause serious injury to someone.  My wife has had the dryer for 3 or 4 years and has not abused it.    I emailed Elchim to advise them of the problem and asked if they would like to test the dryer to see what may have caused it.  I told them I would be happy to send it to them if they sent me a prepaid shipping label.  After receiving no response, I sent a follow up email.  Still no response.    My only intention is to alert buyers/users of this potential danger so that no one gets hurt.
disapointed I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.
It blew out I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn't have a hair dryer during my stay there. I am giving it 1 star, since I can't seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe.
good while it lasted Mine stopped working in less than 3 months.  As I was drying my hair it all of the sudden stopped.  Nothing I could do would make it turn back on.  It wasn't that expensive but I do expect it to last longer than 3 months.
HOT AIR! I've had this blow dryer for just over a year, and it finally started smoking and sparking so bad, I believe it would have caught on fire if I didn't turn it off.  For the last 6months, if not longer,  I've noticed that when I 1st turn it on it smells really hot and the air flow is very low.  But after fiddling with the heat controls and the cool button it will gradually begin to blow at the normal flow.  I've used cheaper blow dryers in the past that I get a minimum of 3-5 yrs out of!!!!  I'ts the weekend and Andis is closed, but I'll attempt to contact them to see if there is anything that they are willing to do, refund/repair or even replace this unit.  Please note that on their website over half of their blow dryers seem to be discontinued, hmm wonder why. I'll update my review once I hear, or don't hear back from this company.
Died after a month of use This dryer worked fine enough for about a month after I bought it from Target - maybe a little slower than my normal drying time, but overall it was fine. I used it around three times a week in the morning. Went to plug it in yesterday and turned it on, and nothing happened but a tiny little pop. Since then I've tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house. Something seems to have shorted out in it. I figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the $20 one should work just as well, but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly, I think I'll pony up the extra $20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future. It's possible mine was just defective, but even if it hadn't gone out on me, I probably would have gotten a nicer dryer for myself as a treat at some point anyway, knowing how often I use blow dryers and how much better they work on my thicker hair.
Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first If I could give this product a negative I would.  Bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first, it great power and heat.  It lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out. I contacted the seller, but I was beyond what they would cover.  Then I contacted the distributor who said &#34;no problem, send back the defective product and we will replace it.&#34;  Neat, sent it back at my cost :(.  Receive the replacement pretty quickly, yay!  Sadly about 6 months later I had the same issue with the new one cutting out, no power.  Not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so I can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month. DONE.
Caught on fire after 6 months Don't let the cheap price draw you in. This hair dryer is not worth it. I tossed my still working hair dryer that I had owned for 8 years when I bought this. 6 months later it caught on fire. Yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell. Frightening! Do not buy!
Not Working I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.
Doesn't switch voltage! I bought this dryer to take on a European vacation with me. I was thrilled with the size when it arrived. I used it a few times in the States before I left and it worked great here.  When I got to Europe, I tried to change the voltage on it and was totally disappointed. The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it. When I turned the knob, it fell out of the appliance completely revealing that it wasn't attached to anything within the appliance!! It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!!  I have hair that must be styled and I had to buy a hair-dryer to use while in Europe.  I would never recommend this to someone buying it for overseas travel. It simply doesn't change voltage.
This product is crap. I should have read the reviews This product is crap. I should have read the reviews! It is so loud you need earplugs to dry your hair. The cord won't retract with out an extended battle. DO NOT BUY!
OVER HEATS!!!!!!!!! After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill.
Could have been better Not a good buy... Nothing like the ion brand!! Doesn't get hot enough to dry thick hair!!! Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!
If you need dual-voltage, spend your money elsewhere Bought this for a monthly back-packing trip to South America. It broke after a week.  It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.
it doesn't come on. what a pure waste of my money I made this order. after i got it, i found out it wasn't working. i plugged it & it refused to come on. it was a pure waste of my money because what's the point if i can't use it. i should have gotten something better or more mature. Now i regret buying it.
Great, for the few months it worked. Like many, this was purchased because of the experience I have had with Andis clippers.  They have lasted 7 years plus.  This was great, at first.  After a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower.  Now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue.  It is less than a year old so I contacted Andis about sending it in for repair.  I have yet to hear back.  Their website points you to the repair facilities in your area.  One problem, they only service Andis clipper products.  It makes me doubt whether Andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it.  If I don't get a response from Andis, I will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside.<br /><br />Update-Still no response, so I called again.  I was told they do not service hair dryers, they simply replace them.  So I am returning it, at my cost, for a replacement.<br /><br />New Update-Received my NEW replacement.  FYI, use a flat rate USPS bubble envelope and shipping will only cost $5.
Doesn't fit my blow dryer. Beware if your dryer has a wide and/or short barrel. Won't fit. There should be a way to find this out before actual purchase, but information on fit is a bit vague.
What happened to great Jerdon 1600W dryer? I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went pop and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).
Can't even give this away I was so excited to receive this hair dryer when it came in the mail!  Well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor. Don't purchase this. My  beautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it. I tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as styling  products but it did not make a difference.  My girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom I considered just giving it to her if she liked it said she  didn't like it at all! It's too late to return it which is definitely my own fault. I am looking for something else to replace it with but I am a little  hesitant to purchase over the internet.
Revlon horror hair dryer!!!! I have read all these reviews about the Revlon RV484 today which is 2/3/2014 and even on this date the Revlon hair dryer that I purchased last summer did the same thing...the cord split where it meets the dryer and a large set of sparks and horrid smell of burning electric permeated my house. What the heck!!!!! People have complained about this product since back in 2007 and it still remains on the market?????? I will contact Revlon and hopefully this dryer will be pulled off the market before some young adult gets seriously hurt or burnt. Very poor design...shame on Revlon!
One Star NOT VERY GOOD
Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful. Too big and heavy.  Needs to be permanently mounted in order to be truly useful.
Terrible I did not enjoy this product.  It was almost too powerful...yes there is such a thing.  The previous bed head Bh407 model was great, why mess with a good thing.  Returned.
Here are the reasons why you shouldn't buy this hair dryer. The picture of the product is deceptive. I bought it on Amazon and what I received was a very cheap looking product. The instructions on how to hang it on the wall is also very confusing. I am concerned about the safety of this product so I have stopped using it. Now I am left with a cheap dryer that I am never going to use. I wish I can return it back without paying a ton on shipping.
Total disappointment! Only used it for 2 weeks. The bottom piece would get too hot! I got burned a couple times and it also melted my extension cord because of the heat. Total disappointment!
Disappointment with dryer I purchased it because it was supposed to be quiet. It's every bit as loud as my old dryer. It's heavy, cumbersome, hard to manage. I kept turning it off because of the location of the buttons on the handle (I didn't have that problem with my old dryer). It kept sucking my hair in the motor area. <br />BUT, I do think there's something to this ion thing. My hair seemed softer and straighter - no frizzies. It also seemed to dry faster. So, I am now on a quest to find a ion dryer that is light, quiet and easy to manage - oh, and doesn't eat my hair.
Extracompact Twinturbo 3500 I just hate it! I gave away my Babyliss thinking this one is better. What a mistake!!! When I use it my hair gets opaque. I'm very disappointment and is too late to return it.
Broke After a Trip I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I'm not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.
I am so disappointed in the failing quality of Conair products Died within a couple months. I am so disappointed in the failing quality of Conair products. Do the controls really need to be under our fingers the whole time?
worst shaver ever This had both good and bad reviews, so i figured i would give it a try. Mistake. Worst shaver ever. I had to take off the plastic piece and just use the blades to make the hair short enough, and it worked for about 2 minutes, and then suddenly all it did was PULL the hair and HURT!!! Don't waste your money.
over heated Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend
Andis Professional Bonnet Dryer Dryer broke during first use between the base and the dryer itself.. It cracked it still worked and dried my hair well however it is made very cheaply with cheap plastic!!:-( :-( :-( :-(
after years of good service - it went out with a bang I have had this hair dryer for a few years, and it has served me well up until now. Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase. Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet).
DANGEROUS PRODUCT!! DO NOT BUY This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &#34;guard&#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer.
Garbage I bought 2 of these because I thought they were very similar to what I had before.  Each lasted about 2 uses before I heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on.  No matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer!
Did not like it Purchase this item use it once and it's already in the box to be return. My daughter have natural hair so its all it easier to come her hair when it's blow dry and this could bit do the job at all.
Very dangerous product - do not buy. My wife has been using this hair dryer for about a year now with no problems until today, when the dryer motor exploded in her hands and she was nearly electrocuted when she tried to unplug it. Reading some of the other reviews, I see that she was very lucky - the casing remained intact and the tiny sharp pieces of the motor remained inside the unit rather than turning into dangerous shrapnel. The Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer is a poorly-designed, dangerous product that should be taken off the market.
disappointing for my waves Meh, it just doesn't work that well for me.  I think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person's head.  Somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head, then sticking out toward the ends.  Not a fan, wish i hadn't tossed the box.
BOO!!  A real QUITTER! I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it. It was light and quiet and fast. I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  About a month ago, it started getting louder. Then it just stopped. I opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside.  I have never dropped this, and it ALWAYS goes back in the drawer...I even wrap and secure the cord every time. I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks. However, its even louder now, like a jet engine and vibrates ferociously. Never again! I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years. HAHA!
Received wrong product Ordered 2 of the 3500, but received the 3200, which was a lower model, lower priced, by mistake. Somehow, I don't believe that. I feel as if they were trying to see if I would notice the difference. Then when I asked for an exchange, they said they didn't have any more of the 3500s. Sounds fishy to me!
My wife was looking forward to it so disappointed really. I ordered from Australia so expected a 220-240 volt model. I was sent a 130 volt model which when plugged-in went bang.<br />So cannot review obviously.<br />When I went back to check the voltage it wasn't readily obvious what it was. It took quite a bit of searching to find out I had bought something unusable in Australia.<br />My wife was  looking forward to it so disappointed really.
Disappointed Was a great dryer. Loved it. However it burned out within 2 months.
Great dryer! I have used the dryer several times and it works great.  I had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision.  Definitely recommend.
It's hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 ... It's hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts. It doesn't get hot at all you can hold it directly towards your scalp and it's only warm. Definitely not worth the money.
It will collapse on your head often I've finally decided to replace this dryer.  For the past few months I've been making do with it because I don't have the receipt to return it.  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  I will say again  -  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say 'lock')the hood in place. If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse. If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  I have not used it one time without this happening.  I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  This dryer is also very loud.  Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  It's just that bad.  I wish I never purchased it and can't wait to replace it.  If you need cheap heat this is fine.  If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.
DANGEROUS!! DANGEROUS!!!<br />This hair dryer is SO NOT WORTH YOUR $$$$!!!  As reported by other reviewers the flat sliding on/off switch was difficult to operate, especially if your hands were not totally dry.  The folding handle stopped staying open after 6mo.  This created a significant pinching hazard.  After 9mo the dryer began to over heat each time it was used.
Way too big and too heavy I agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was.  I didn't even take it out of the package; ended up returning it on my own dime.
One Star Cord has unmovable stop on it. Space is limited and I needed the cord to retact into handle completely.
No good! I've only had this for about six months and it's goes off and on while I'm using it. Then today after the dryer had been off for over an hour it started humming as if it were &quot;stuck&quot; on. Can't return because it doesn't fall withing amazons return time!!! NOT NOT NOT HAPPY... DO NOT BUY!!!!!
Doesn't fit Of the two blow dryers that I own, this attachment fits neither.
Didn't last long... I bought this hair dryer less than two months ago and it has stopped blowing hot air. I tried cleaning it, adjusting the settings, and pressing the &#34;test&#34; and &#34;reset&#34; buttons on the plug. Very disappointing!
Andis 82005 1875 watts I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, & I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome & heavy & too large  & the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.  I am not a happy customer...
Sorry piece of junk My husband purchased this dryer for me. within a couple of uses it stopped blowing hot air. He reminds me all the time how much money he spent and how it can't be used.
Waste of Money I bought this hair drier for my girlfriend 3 months ago, expecting it to be great. The attachments do not attach to the drier! It is now useless to her and too late to exchange the product.
Disappointed... I only got to use it 1.5 times when I was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out.... I would like a refund but don't know how to go about it. I used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out
my hair is still wet! This hair dryer has 2 speed's, slow and slower!  It takes forever to dry hair.  Instead of looking forward to getting ready I dread washing my hair knowing how long it will take.  I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  If you have thin hair this may work for you, but I have thick wavey hair and this dryer has no power or heat to style me.  I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for this product...this is no salon dryer!! Very disappointed :(  Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @ the same price (amazon has none in stock at the moment) but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.
Don't waste your money on this Don't believe the &#34;High-velocity airflow&#34; statement - this hair dryer only had a low & medium setting.  I don't have what people would call a thick head of hair and it took a long time for me to dry what I have.  The hair brush was flimsy and the bristles were mangled when I received it.  Another thing I didn't like was that it is quite heavy and the handle is long so it makes it seem even heavier when you are holding it.  I ended up returning it since it was pretty useless to to.
Buyer beware--broke after 3 months The dryer broke after 3 months and the company won't honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller.  But the company told me that for a mere 54.95 they will bend the rules replace it for me.  Steer clear.
not that great the cord is convenient, but its not long enough. and the power is not strong enough (the blowing action).  i would have returned it but i was moving at the time and didnt have time to do it.
Terrible value. Terrible product.  Cheaply made, loud and doesn't have much power.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Save your money and buy the Onel MK-II..
Another mistake There is no way to adjust the height of the bonnet.  The high setting will burn your scalp and the low setting takes too long. And this is the top of the line???
Never Buy Anything from TheDiscountCenter it is Counterfeit! I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!
Vendor is odd--cheaper elsewhere I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).
1 year was not long enough December 2015 Review:<br />Well, despite what I wrote earlier, this blow dryer did not last as long as I'd hoped it would. Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself. You do have 30 days to return, although I will not be returning mine.
MEGA DEALS STORE is selling unauthentic products I purchased this from MEGA DEALS STORE.  It was broken upon opening the pkg.  They sent me a new one.  The motor burned out shortly thereafter.  So they sent me a new one again. Now about 1.5 years later, another motor has burned out. It's not like I even use it every day! I contacted them once again and they will not return my emails.<br /><br />I have had a T3 before that I purchased directly from the T3 website.  It lasted 5+ years with no problems. There's no way that the T3 I purchased from MEGA DEALS STORE is authentic.<br /><br />I gave them the benefit of the doubt twice, but I should have followed my instinct.  If the price is too good to be true, it probably is.
I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer.  The button on it didn't work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  It was a total waste of money.
nearly burned my house down! Do not  buy this Hair dryer! Mine caught fire when it was plugged in  but not turned on. If I had not been home it  would have burned down my house! As it was, I smelled smoke and  was able to put out the fire! Very scary ! I was  lucky I did not get burned and nothing was damaged. I will never buy another Conair product again!<br />C.
Lousy design Pros: Dries hair. Folds in half.     Cons: Awkward buttons that won't budge at first, then leap past the desired setting. Retractable cord should be called stuffable cord. Stopped working after 6 months.
Poorly Designed The very first time I used this dryer, it sucked my long hair into the back of it and knotted it up.  Had to cut the hair off.  Definitely going back, and I would not recommend this to anyone.
Stopped working, after 6 months My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest Jerdon stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that's it.
not so good I thought these rollers were really cute but I ended up giving them away. I dont know if its that the heat is uneven or, or maybe the rollers are too small, or what, but I never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these.  I dont think they heat up particularly quickly, either. They might be good for a kid.
Buyer beware! Buyer beware!  I have owned this hair dryer less than 9 months.  While drying my 5 year old daughter's hair it shut off.  We thought we just needed to reset it on the plug.  After doing that and turning it back on we heard a loud snap.  It burned through the cord near the handle and left black marks on my husband's hand.  Thank goodness my daughter wasn't hurt.  What a dangerous piece of garbage.
Will not purchase again Did not last nearly as long as it should of, poorly made
defective product The cool air button doesn't work at all.<br />Other buttons are all right but I am not satisfied with the product.
Blew up after 5 months I was very happy with it for the first 5 months, but was shocked this morning when it made a loud bang and tripped the circuit breaker.  I have never had a hair dryer break in this short amount of time.  Buyer beware.  I can't return it, but I'll write Remington and let them know what I think of their product.
Disappointed in Amazon I can't believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?
already broke i have only had this for alittle over a month and it broke today. will never buy another one from here.
No warranty We bought the T3 Featherweight through Amazon less than a year ago. The dryer died yesterday. I contacted T3 and they stated that they would not honor their warranty because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. They offered to replace the dryer for $50.00. I advised them I would let Amazon know that the dryers they are selling are not backed by a warranty because they are not an authorized dealer.  Sounds like a bunch of manure to me.
Not Authentic First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake.
One Star Problems using with uk adaptor
Waaaay Too Loud, Don't Buy I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.
Junk This thing is junk.  Got it for my wife after her other wall mounted hair dryer died.  She hates it.  Not enough power.
Defective there is Spark fire come from inside I think this is defective one
Stinky dryer The chemical odor associated with this dryer is so bad, even after sitting out for a week, I had to return it.  Maybe need a different manufacturing process...
Disappointed I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don't know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped.
Overheated hairdryer that burns hair! This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.
Battery Questions are a Mystery - Not Eco Friendly About Spinbrush庐 Swirl庐 electric toothbrush by Arm & Hammer.  So I was trying to figure out how to change the battery/s for this toothbrush --- for a long time - lol too long! And I was feelin' a bit dumb (lol). I had  always had a problem with the switch with the  Arm & Hammer Spinbrush庐 Swirl庐. tooth brush - it was easy to turn on but it was actually a puzzle (not intuitive, to me anyway) to shut off. LOL - I knew the design of this T/Brush had out smarted me in the past so putting ego aside I went to the Web with my problem and to the Electric Tooth Brush Manufacture's site [...] by Arm & Hammer. I must say this is Very FLASH-e Web Site. (lol) Very typical, over the top - big company stuff! Designed for the Suit Client not the Toothbrush Customer. The web sit does not have a Site Search Field, I knew I was in for it right then!  YES there is a Q & A page but there is a lame Ask Us page that is really just a badly titled where to buy landing page., ([...]). It seems like you need to go two levels of pages in on this site to discover this page link found on the ASK US PAGE: [...] On the  FAQ page, How to change the battery for this model Spinbrush庐 Swirl庐 was an unanswered question, others yes full and complete How To's, but not for this model! Curious? Which led me to Amazon to see what others knew about the Arm & (and) Hammer Spinbrush庐 Swirl庐. I found my answer at Amazon. It seems instead of just saying that you have to toss this thing in the landfill where it will last for who know's how long the A&H approach is omission. Just not talking about the issue with their customers? It was almost like they were too embarrassed to put in writing the truth about such an un-ecofriendly electric tooth brush. Lessons I learned: I wasted a lot of time, I found the solution to my problem very quickly on Amazon, & I got what I paid for when I bought the cheapest Electric Toothbrush I could find. I am embarrassed to put this in the garbage but that's where it is.
Curls or thick hair ? DON'T BUY . Revlon RV474 1875W Frizz Control Hair Dryer<br />My grandma purchased this dryer for me about a year ago .<br /><br />I currently have a very expensive one given to me by my mom , but it was hers and it's very old . So I thought It would be great . WRONG . It doesn't blow hardly AT ALL even on the high .<br />The cool setting is great , but other than that it's horrible . And I have thick , kinky curls , so this dryer didn't help if I needed it dried quickly to straighten or dried just to wear my curls . It burned my hair and did NOT reduce frizz .<br />For my little sister , it's fine . She has thick straight hair , but it gets the job done ... in about two hours !
One Star Did not stay on.
Don't trust the picture! This toothpaste does not have fluoride! I made the mistake of trusting that the picture on this product page was actually a picture of what I would get.  It clearly says that it is SLS-Free Fluoride toothpaste.  The toothpaste I received is SLS-free, but does not have fluoride.  I'm in the process of returning it.
Won't Last 4 Months.. I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair.
Never worked right...waste of money I bought this hair dryer in May and ever since I got it, when I turn it on it runs for a while and then it just shuts off , I have to wait between 10 and 15 minutes for it to come back on.  I would really like an exchange and I have not figured out how to contct you.  This hair dryer is still under warranty.  Please advise me what I am supposed to do as this was a pretty expensive hair dryer and it has been cutting out since I got it.  I could not find a way to reach you.  Hoping someone will contact me soon.  Thank you
My $15 hair dryer from Wal-Mart lasted longer! This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!
One Star Stopped working after 3 months.
Burn baby burn Interesting to see others say theirs caught fire as mine did too, while it was in my hand!! It started smoking and the handle turned red & hot. Recall this bad boy!!
Terrible I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.
Absolute Waste of Money! This hair dryer is a waste of money!  Purchase a Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler - $34.99  OR  Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer - $39.99  Works better and saves you a heap of money.  This dryer is NOT worth $139.99!!!
Last resort The teeth of the comb are way too small and I feel like l'm really damaging/pulling out my hair when I blow dry it. If I blow dryer smaller sections It will take all day. I have thick afro hair so I think I need a higher end blow dryer.
Stopped working after three months I was optimistic about this hairdryer but a few weeks in, a rattling noise started. Then after a few months, it totally stopped blowing warm air and I'm have to replace it. Would not recommend this product. It was a total waste of money.
Great While It Worked This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.<br /><br />Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.
Warning - Ours caught Fire I bought two of these in March of 2011.  Within 12 months the first one died.  This morning, after 32 months of use, the second one caught fire in my wife's hand.  These are not a quality product and are even dangerous.
Conair I never received it. But went out to get another and hated it. It does not have a warm just hot so I burnt my hair and my childrens to the point my hair is damaged in front. I do not like this product at all. Besides the color I would never let anyone use this product.
One Star This item is pink and it is not clearly advertised as such.
Dryer overheats and would not work Ordered this and upon arrival the dryer stopped working. It would turn on and work for a few seconds and then overheat. Not pleased with this purchase. I have used similar Andis dryers in the past without problem, this one was a dud.
DOES NOT HAVE COOL SHOT BUTTON The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.<br /><br />The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.
Don't waste your money! I agree with the first review, I bought the same dryer and it only lasted for eight weeks.  It began fizzing and spewing sparks - very scary for a hair dryer.    Do not waste your money on this brand - it's very low quality and not worth the investment.
STAY AWAY FROM T3!!!! My experiences with this hairdryer and this company are X4.  I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!
P.O.S. This thing died within a month of purchase. Bought it for the girlfriend to use when she visited. So it wasn't even everyday use for that month.
HATE IT! I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.
One Star If you have all the time in the world鈥uy this hair dryer. Agonizingly slow!
Waste of money This hair dryer died within 4 months of buying it. Waste of money.
Dont Buy Do  not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap
Please don't buy this item Please don't buy this. I used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when I turn it on. It should go to trash now.
Would not recommend I purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work. Would not recommend
Did not like this at all Did not like this at all. My hair took longer to dry and it was so loud!!! Returned immediately
do not recommend I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.
no value Save your money, this dryer is cheap and rightfully so.  The blower is not very powerful and the new method of covering the small filter on the back of the fan is a small hinged door that keeps popping open.  I removed the small filter thinking it would then stay shut and it still pops open.  I have used Conair for years and always been happy, but this one is a piece of... ah Junk.
Gets extremely hot - I have burned my hand on ... Gets extremely hot - I have burned my hand on both the metal grate as well as the plastic body. After use I have to keep on the counter because it is too hot to put away. It has melted 2 different combs and now starts to smoke during use. My hair requires high heat to dry completely and not be frizzy, but this is unsafe and ridiculous. As soon as my new model arrives (not this brand) this is going in the trash!
Flawed design You plug it in and it blows warm, almost hot, air.  Both buttons are perfectly placed to maximize accidentally turning off the dryer in the middle of a blowout.  The cord becomes so twisted and tangled that you won't be able to get a foot from the outlet (hey, you'll never have to worry about dropping it in the tub!).
... had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years I had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years.  I still have one but one the other one broke I reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months
Broke within 5 months After limited use in 5 months, the unit only works on low.<br />Will need to get a replacement.
It's going to explode! Okay, maybe not exactly explode, but very close.  After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!), I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don't use this setting very often, it's just using coils it doesn't usually use- wrong!  Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  I hope that maybe it'll work again after cooling off, much to my husband's amusement who said that smell only comes with electronic death, but no, it's forever dead.
stay away This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn't dry hair as well as the old conair I had.<br />Next!
Rediculous design The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.
One Star burned up first time used
don't waste your money and put holes in your wall I have purchased two of these units.  First one lasted a year before burning out.  Thought it was the way my wife was using it that was the problem so I purchase another one and it now it is an expensive night light.  It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.
Don't buy it! I have had three T3 hair dryers. I really liked the lightweight aspect but the heat control stopped working on all of them including the travel version. It is impossible to use any of them because the the high heat gets so hot now that it burns my hair. If I put it on a lower setting  the air is just less forceful. The worst part is that I contacted the company and they didn't even respond. I will never buy anything from this company again.
Hair dryer stopped working after only a few months Loved this hairdryer until it stopped working today. It just quit. Reset button won't fix it. Very disappointed as I had a much cheaper hairdryer and it lasted years. This has only lasted 3 months!
Broken within a year While the dryer did work well, it lasted only a year before the fan on the motor broke, rendering the hair dryer useless.  In my opinion, this is shoddy workmanship and not worth the money spent.  So, I would recommend finding another hair dryer to purchase rather than this model.
Don't buy this or any other Andis products The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!
Not good for fine hair I do not like this hair dryer at all. What a waste! I have fine hair and it's pretty long - to the middle of my back - and when I use this dryer, it tangles my hair with the fine little knots that hurt to get out and break my hair. It doesn't get hot enough for me, even on the high/hot setting and it does nothing for my bangs. Like other people have said, the buttons are right on the handle and get in the way when you're holding it, so that's annoying. It is heavier than my old dryer and I can't get used to that. So, basically, I have to go buy yet another hair dryer b/c I can't imagine being stuck with this one for the next 5 or so years. Sorry I even got this.
HATE HATE HATE! This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living. It is super heavy and doesn't even blow hot air. I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it. Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.
Do not buy Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product. Very loud and only dries one section of your head.
Never worked! The ground fault circuit interrupter (the little red button) never worked and so the dryer never worked either. It was designed so that the GFCI couldn't be opened or repaired.<br />This was a total waste of money. Of course we never used it until the day AFTER the return date expired.
Warning! I have owned two of this same product now.  Both have started to shoot sparks within less than one year.  Be warned.  This is a hazardous dryer.
Conair Hair Dryer Worked great when 1st used. small size makes it easy to hold and use.  Quit working after 1 months use.
Cheap Quality I couldn't get the hose to stay attached (locked) to the bonnet. Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times. That was enough for me to return it.
waste of money. It's too loud, so i didn't used it a lot,(like aroud seven times)the last time i used it, it stop working suddenly and it smells like something just burned, already is in the dumpster.
One Star Boughtt in July 2013....now the hot setting goes from hot to cold all while in the HOT setting.....
Don't buy this dryer I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don't buy this - it's junk.
DO NOT BUY * Does not work overseas! I bought this hair dryer for travel to England & Ireland, along with an adapter.  The dryer was advertised as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  That was a FALSE statement.  The FIRST time we plugged it in, it Fried!!!!  It was a huge waste of money.  I will NEVER by a Conair dryer again.
Andis 30970 Hangup 1600W Hair Dryer w/cord Very cheap! Not much blowing power and very little heat. I can not recommend this product. I forgot to mention it is also VERY NOISY! Spend a little more money and get you a good one.   David/Ohio
Don't Buy It! The second time I used the hair dryer, it stopped mid-drying and never worked again!  A total waste of money.
not worth it I purchased 1 and it stopped working in only a few months with only a few uses per week. I contacted customer service and they wanted $100 plus $14.95 to replace it. They don't stand by their products claiming that the serial numbers aren't enough to authenicate their products. Blah blah blah. Not worth the price tag and doesn't live up to the hype.
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED! ANOTHER BLOW DRYER THAT CAUSES FLYAWAY HAIR AND THE FRIZZIES!  I WISH SOMEONE KNEW OF A MINI DRYER THAT ACTUALLY STRAIGHTENS BANGS!  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DRYER DOES NOT DO THE TRICK, I AM SORRY TO SAY!
DO NOT BUY THIS unless you're drying doll's heads! Bonnet is so rediculously small it could not be placed on head of adult, let alone dry hair on rollers.I can't imagine what the &#34;professional&#34; is, certainly not a hair salon with this &#34;quality!&#34;  Disappointing.  Time consuming. Received when I got home 5/7. Diirected by Amazon to be returned by 5/7!  Silly waste.
Unannounced formula change I have used Retro Daily Shampoo for a few years and was delighted with it, in particular because it contained no Sulfates. Unfortunately the Retro I received had a label New improved Formula on front and when I read the ingredients I discovered they have added Sulfates to the shampoo. I therefore had to return it and although the retrun experience was good  I was disappointed in the change in the product.
and it smelled like wires were burning Do not order this product!  My first one lasted 6 months-the fan quit working and it almost caught fire.. Returned it for an exchange.  They sent me an opened item with visible marks, etc.  Guess what?  The same issue again.. No fan, and it smelled like wires were burning.  I have no desire to return or deal with Andis.  This product is dangerous and as far as I am concerned, it is not merchantable.  Do yourself a favor, Stay away from this hair dryer.  It is absolutely no good.
quality problem锛侊紒锛?"Just only use about one and half month  when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly. it's some part of inside the dryer was broken I guess and I really want to return this item锛両 was very angry about the quality of this dryer!"
Worst Hair Dryer. The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?
DANGEROUS!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!! BE WARNED ---- Don't buy unless you want a fire on your hands. IF YOU HAVE ONE THROW IT AWAY!!! This product exploded in my hands just as I plugged it in and I have only had it for a few weeks.  If you read other reviews on this you will see that this is not the first or second time that this has happened and the supplier is refusing to refund.  Totally shabby treatment all around!!!! AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SITE!!! [[ASIN:B000M7YQOM Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer]]
producto defectuoso this product does not work well ensendido the button came broken and I can not turn off<br /><br />este producto no trabaja bien el boton de ensendido vino roto y no lo puedo apagar
hairdryer with light I bought this item and when it received the box was in bad shape, the dryer work, but the light didn't. I sent it back in the same box it was received and they returned one that didn't even run. I would not reccommend this iten to anyone. I bought the same one from target and it works gread. I would recommend you not to order it from amazon.
very poor design I ordered two of these and returned them immediately. The suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when I place my head there. If this problem is rectified, it will be a good product. I have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results. These have a flaw in their design which renders them useless.
The concentration attachment falls off repeatedly, and I mean ... The concentration attachment falls off repeatedly, and I mean every time I use the dang thing. Another deal breaker is the length of the cord, it's way too short. This blow dryer is going to be replaced.
BEWARE!! THIS SELLER IS NOT AUTHORIZED! If dryer stops working, you are up a creek with wet hair and no dryer!! Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.
Junk The biggest waste of money I've ever spent. This drier has to be a fake t3 because I've used a t3 for many years and loved it. This drier however gets hot enough, but there's absolutely no power behind it to blow dry the hair. Essentially it's just barely blowing while heating up my hair. My hair takes forever to dry with this thing and after its finally dry it's a frizzy mess. This company seems dishonest as well because in the box there was a large piece of paper stating that they'll give a lifetime warranty if I give a good review! So they're not standing by their product but instead they're essentially trying to pay me to lie! I'm sorry, but I have to be honest and the drier is a piece of junk.
Beware electrical GFI doesn't work! I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...
Broke after just 2 months Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money.
Disappointing I have had this blowdryer for about a year and it already died.  Ironically, it is the most expensive blow dryer I have ever bought and shortest life as well.  Disappointing...
Don't buy Do not buy this Hair Dryer.  I have it since May 2014 and it stops working after a few minutes and will not turn back on.  Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  Since I paid about $20.00 for the hair dryer it is not worth it to replace it when I can buy another brand.
My 19 dollar Conair works better than this This product does not work well at all. My 19 dollar Conair works better than this.  I made contact with T3 on their website, they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system.
Horrible I bought this dryer based on reviews. I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get 1st degree burns on my palm. I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer. Stay away!!!!!!
Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about ... Size was good for a travel dryer and worked well for about 6 months until the handle literally started melting from the inside. I noticed that it was slowly getting hot and over a matter of weeks there was a melted hole in the handle. I live in the US so there's no issue of changing voltage, etc. Worst and most dangerous purchase of my life. Pay a little more money and try something else.
Four times was NOT a charm I bought this hairdryer under the impression that I was getting some magnificent piece of equipment. At $200, this magnificent piece of equipment starting whistling at me within DAYS of using it. I went back to the store, and they kindly exchanged it. About one week later, it began whistling again. I went back to the store and they exchanged it for me. The third hairdryer I received didn't whistle until about a month of using it. Because this hairdryer got so many great reviews, I was willing to exchange it one more time, and so, I got my fourth hairdryer in 2008. It worked great up until about four days ago when I smelled something that smelled like it was burning. That alarmed me, but I ignored it. Then two days later, I heard something pop inside my hairdryer. After that, there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it! I finally had had enough, so today, I returned my hairdryer and got my money back. My husband did some research, and we found a great $35 hairdryer that works just as well, if not better, than the $200 piece of crap that I had to return multiple times.
Great concept but exceedingly short shelf life I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.
Heating element dies The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable.
Disappointed. I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!<br /><br />Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price.
not pleased We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great. But just a month before a problem? Unacceptable at any price.
Purchased New; Looks Used! Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!  Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:B000LQB5YS T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]
Hair Dryer blew up in my hand....shocked and burned I purchased this blow dryer and was initially happy with it until it EXPLODED IN MY HAND while I was drying my hair.  I first felt a weird sensation going up my arm and then a huge hot stab in my back right before the dryer EXPLODED IN MY HAND, with pieces flying everywhere the motor was still running and I could not release it from my grip.  It hurt so bad and feels like my insides in my back are on fire!  Not only am I in pain, it scared me pretty bad!  I will be getting a completely different dryer now. I will never purchase another Andis dryer!
Shorts out. Had this for 6 months has been shorting out  pretty much from the beginning, I think it has a 30 day return policy...
NOT DUAL VOLTAGE Bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs, and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling, I purchased this item (there was no information about the voltage on product description, but it was available for shipping internationally so I deduced that it is dual voltage). Amazon shipped this item to Singapore (220volts). Once I tried it on, it fried my adaptor plug, and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds. Such a dissapointment!
Defective We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it.
Cute but cold! This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature.  I gave up trying to dry my hair.
Loved it at first but then it started shooting out sparks! I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  I'm just glad and lucky that the sparks didn't land on my hair and cause a fire or anything.
Conair 1875 Conair 1875 hair dryer<br /><br />stopped working in less than a month.  The reset button won't click, so it won't start.  Don't feel like the hassle of trying for a credit or return, don't have packaging.  Am going to buy local where I can easily return something.
Don't buy - worked less than one year I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now.
Piece of rubbish I was really looking forward to this. Got it in the mail. Plugged it in and it did not work. I am sending it back.
Plug Prongs Overheating -- Beware I've had the Conair Ion Shine 1875 for about 6 months and haven't been particularly unhappy with the dryer. I wouldn't even be writing a review if I hadn't burned my fingers on the plug this morning. I have very thin, fine hair and don't need to use the blow dryer more than 3 minutes in order to dry my hair. There's absolutely no reason for the prongs on the plug to heat to the point that they become a branding iron. I let the plug cool down and checked it in another outlet to be sure the problem lay in the dryer and not in the electrical outlet, and the prongs heated to the point of burning in under a minute.    Needless to say, the dryer went straight in the trash. (After the plug cooled down.) I'll be saving my receipt for the next dryer (which won't be a Conair) that I purchase.
Defective product I bought this hairdryer ...twice ...for the retractable cord.  On the  first one I received the cord didn'tretract at all so I returned it and asked for a replacement. I  figured it was a fluke. Replacement was only slightly better. Cord retraction was rough and sporactic. So I returned for a refund. Amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers. So I may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience! It is just a defective design...My husband picked up one at Target and the retractable cord didn't work on it either!
Works well... if it works at all I purchased these clippers about 5 months ago to start cutting my own hair. I got about 6 good haircuts with it, but unfortunately ran into one large issue. The more I used it, the gradually harder it was to move the power switch on and off. Eventually, the power switch jammed completely, and I was no longer able to turn the thing on. I sent the clipper to Wahl to get it repaired, paying around 15 dollars for shipping, and got it back around 2 weeks later. I used the clippers twice since then, and now the power switch is back to being jammed. This thing is no better than a paper-weight to me now. I really regret purchasing this clipper, and will be purchasing a new pair from a different brand sometime very soon.
Too bad the container is poorly designed! About two years ago, I discovered this product and fell in love quickly only to be disappointed. As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent and it really works without leaving a residue. The problem, which I am unable to overcome, is the issue with the sprayer getting clogged. Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row. I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle. I never tried sticking an earring in it like another reviewer suggested, but I had enough. Probably because of their embarassment, one of the cosmetic store employees told me they had heard Ojan was improving their bottle. So I waited diligently for about a year before purchasing another bottle only to find that, just like before, after about 2 uses, the nozzle clogs.     DEAR OJAN - PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR PACKAGING DESIGN SO I CAN CONTINUE TO USE YOUR PRODUCT!!! It is a horrible design flaw that has to cost a ton of money in returns and in loss of potential return customers - LIKE ME!    Now I use Oscar Blandi's power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better. I have heard similar reports in Blandi's spray and have avoided it as a result. Fuhrer's didn't really do much for me and a drugstore brand named Salon Grafix (SG) works effectively but smells like old lady hairspray.
WHAT A WASTE! This blowdryer is not worth the money!  I bought it less than a year ago and not only is the claim cut your blowdrying time in half a lie, (it takes me 1 hr and 15 minutes to blowdry my hair), lately it has been blowing out cold air all of a sudden in the middle of my blowdrying session.  Also, if you don't purchase from an authorized dealer your warranty will not be honored.  The t3 bespoke labs people don't even have an official website!  This is a farce! Don't waste your time and money.
Junk I purchased this product and within one week there was no warm/hot air at all.  Only cold air.  Save your money.
bomb you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it's worth it it
We have bought at least 6 of these.. ... We have bought at least 6 of these....and they all inexplicably die within a matter of one year!!  I should have stopped ordering replacements, lazy on our part so we could just use the same wall mounts.  Time to try another brand!!!
Damaged Item I bought this item for my elderly mother.<br />She and others have tried to use it but<br />the hose keeps coming detached from the<br />bonnet.<br />I would not purchase this product again<br />or recommend it.
was not as advertised This hair dryer was listed with a &#34;cool shot&#34; which I specifically wanted.  When it arrived I noticed it did not have that feature.  I decided to keep it anyway and plugged it in.  It ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Never to run again.  I have another Andis product and it works fine.  I could have paid to ship this item back which seems wrong to me since it was not as advertised.
Disappointed My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!
Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for ... Item came missing the connecting screw. Still waiting for someone to get back to me. One more business day and I'm going to request a refund and return.
Overpriced and underperforms This has hardly any power.. there is another product Pro Beauty Tools Pbdr5886 Professional Travel Hair Dryer, White and Black  which is far cheaper at $25 and 1800 watts, ionic and dual voltage. I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That's it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says.
- DO NOT BUY - the 5 star reviews are fake Few problems with this Dryer.<br />First: I've had this dryer before. It was great, but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working, as they do.<br />Second: The FIRST time I plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work (as in, no air came out). I contacted the seller and I've received no response. The dryer is not working, and I just want a different one.<br />Third: This seller is a complete scam! They send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they'll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review. Complete extortion. I can't believe Amazon works with these guys. Mind you, since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer's warrantee is void. This creates a problem.<br /><br />Bottom line: buy this from a different seller.
Good while it lasted. I purchased this product about a month ago.  It had good air flow, although I had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume.  However, I thought it was sufficient. Then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks. It was still within the time frame of being returnable, so I did return it and Amazon has refunded me.  I will not repurchase.
Bristles on brush defective After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.
It's called snake oil... A colleague bought one of these and raved about it.  I borrowed it so my wife could try: yes, it is lightweight... but so are most $20 hairdryers.  Wife said it didn't dry any faster, didn't impress her as being anything special.  Someone is laughing hard all the way to the bank with this.
Died on Day 1, First Use! I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.<br /><br />Reminds me of the saying: Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day
Stops Working! At first it was great, but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now, not even a year old has stopped working completely :(
IT BURNED MY HAIR OFF I have the silver version of this exact blowdryer- i had it for about a year and always used an attachment on the end of it. then all of the sudden the attachment wasn't fitting right and so i used it for about a month without it. I have always noticed how hot the dryer got but didn't think anything of it. I was blowdrying my hair with a round brush and suddenly smelt burning hair. Much to my surprise, it had burnt that chunk of my hair completely off and i now have a patch of very short, miscolored, burnt hair on my head. HORRIBLE product. I looked at the attachment also and the plastic on the inside is completely melted from it getting too hot. No wonder it wasn't fitting anymore.
A Piece of Junk This is a piece of junk.  Set it up on the high watt setting, but found that it would not operate after my wife dried her hair. Setting it on the lower watt setting solved the problem for a few months.  Now the same thing often happens and it makes lots of noise.  I think it will stop entirely very soon.  Tried cleaning the lint out several times.  The lint screen is buried under plastic strips making it difficult to clean.
DO NOT PURCHASE! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.
Not happy with this dryer The biggest complaint I have about this dryer is that the buttons which are very sensitive are located exactly where your fingers go in order to hold it so I am constantly hitting them by mistake. To try to avoid that makes you hold the dryer in a very awkward manner. You would think they would notice when testing.  It is also heavy and bulky. I did not notice any additional shine to my hair.  The low setting is really cool and the hot is not very hot.  Takes a lot longer to dry my very short hair.  The only thing I did like was the hanging hoop. If I hadn't purchased it a long time ago as a back-up dryer I would return it.
If you're looking for a retractable cord, don't buy this one! My previous Conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and I loved it.  It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.  And finally, the dual voltage switch--I can't, for the life of me, get that thing to switch over.  I've tried using my acrylic nails, a screwdriver, my boyfriend, etc. and nothing has worked.  Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.  I may chuck the thing out a window next week!<br /><br />If anybody is interested in the Conair blow dryer I had prior to this one, it was the Conair YOU Cord Reel 2-in-1 Hair Dryer.  It last me years and the retractable cord worked great!
HIGHLY DANGEROUS I owned this dryer for a year when flames shot out of where the dryer connected to the electrical cord.  As a result, my nightgown and chest were burnt.  The burn I sustained took four weeks to heal and left a two inch scar on my chest.  Frankly, despite the severity of the incident, I was grateful that my face or hair were not involved in the incident.  As I thought the malfunction was due to wear and tear, I purchased another one.  After five months, the dryer gave off sparks from the same location.  I was not injured that time.  I contacted Revlon and encouraged them to recall or discontinue the model.  DO NOT purchase this product -- I consider it highly dangerous.
Not up to Conair's quality I bought this product Dec 8,2006, and it lasted till Aug 20, 2007.  It's not worth the cost to ship back.  It just stopped working.  My last Conair hair dryer lasted some 15 or more years.  Think I'll check out some other brands by checking out these great reviews on Amazon. Don't buy this hair dryer, you will be greatly disappointed.
It does not contain a cool shot button The description for this product is incorrect.  It does not contain a cool shot button.
BUMMER I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great.  I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on.  The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund.  Bummer!
I have had this hair dryer less than 2 months...no longer works right. This hair dryer did not last even two months.  My hair would get caught in the back of the dryer.  Never had this problem with other hair dryers.  It is already useless and I had to replace it with another hair dryer.
Heating Element Dies Quickly Do NOT buy this hair dryer!  I purchased one just over a year ago, and the heating element died after 6 months (and I don't even use it daily).  Not being a fast learner, I bough the same dryer, and guess what?  6 months later, the heating element died.<br /><br />Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I will not be purchasing another Revlon dyer again.
I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on ... I couldn't find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off. I went through about 5 different ones.
One Star Hard to flex into position.
Base is NOT sturdy! I purchased this item last year and used it once. It worked very well. However, I became pregnant and didn't have time to focus on my hair. When I went back to use it again earlier this year, it toppled over and the legs on the base broke. I tried gluing it together but it didn't work. I am disappointed because I was hoping to be able to use this for a while but I guess not.<br /><br />The top is definitely WAY too heavy for the base it comes with. Hoping I can find something that will suffice or buy a replacement base. Otherwise, that's $104 down the drain. Not cool...
Don't waste your money! Not what I expected. The dryer is poorly made.  The nozzle flies off about 3-4 times while I'm drying my hair.  It's very annoying!  I will most likely return.
Not Quiet; Fried My Hair If you're extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer, this is not for you.  Still had to wear earplugs during use; I wasn't expecting a whisper-quiet operation for the price, but this is NOT QUIET. It still woke up someone sleeping in the next room.<br /><br />Even using the dryer as far as I could reach from my head, while using a round ceramic brush, this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair. I now have tons of split ends that I did not have while using (what I thought was) an inferior dryer.  The $15 cheapo dryer I picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level.
quit within a couple of months Must have got a dud but ours died!
BUYER BEWARE!!! Lasted 7 months.  In that 7 months it sporatically shuts itself off.  Now its completely dead.  The manufacturer won't warranty it because amazon is not an authorized dealer.    My $10 conair has lasted at least 15 years!  What a waste.
makes noise but nothing else!! I bought this and tried it thinking Wahl was a good brand.  This thing is horrible!!!  It does not cut hair.  It's truly like the blades are missing.  Don't waste your time.
Doesn't get hot enough to dry my hair This dryer blows nicely, but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly. It takes a really long time to dry hair, and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat. I waited too long to return it, so am stuck with it.Going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing. Be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough. Mine may be defective.
Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days Definetely this hair dryer sucks, it did not last not even 30 days. I only used once a day, & it got burned out. I regret not to pay attention to the bad reviews which they were saying the thruth.
DO NOT BUY - WARRANTY ISSUES This product comes with a one year warranty from the merchant as opposed to a four year warranty from the manufacturer. There is no serial number attached to the power cord so you can't register for warranty.  Also our product made a distinctive sound that we did not have when we bought our first hair dryer from the manufacturer directly 5 years ago... Lesson learned, wanted to try to save on the purchase price, lost on the quality and warranty. Attempting to return the product. I would advise not to buy this product from this merchant.
Fooled Again This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience.
Took it back I liked the feel of it in my hand, but it was incredibly loud.  I thought I should wear hearing protection while I used it.  I couldn't take it.  Also, the retractable cord worked only part of the time.  I returned it and bought a Remington.  I would definitely not recommend the Conair Cord-Keeper to a friend.
Not a good product. The electrical plug was unsteady from day one. Now, less than six weeks later the plug won't stay in the outlet at all.  It has been a little over 30 days so I cannot return it to Amazon.  I am very disappointed.
... this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it. The hot setting is too hot and ... I bought this on the recommendation of my stylist and I hate it.  The hot setting is too hot and burns my scalp, the &#34;power&#34; is too strong and makes my hair completely flat and yet, doesn't seem to dry it unless it's on these higher settings.  Also, it is a very heavy hair dryer.  I am very disappointed in this product.  Wish I had kept the box to return.  This is not worth the splurge.
Broke within 2 months usage The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.
Unhappy with retractable cord This product was a terrible disappointment. The retractable cord stopped retracting almost the first time I used it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! It's HUGE!  It was described as more of a travel dryer, but it's way too big to put in a suitcase, and too expensive for quality, cheap looking plastic.
disappointed Have owned this hairdryer for less than six months, and it has already ceased to work.  Very, very disappointed because I like the style and the size of the unit.  It just stopped working; wasted my money!
Really Bad Product After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I'll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.
disappointed with Amazon This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina
A BIG WATSE OF MONEY Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.
Low quality Motor went out after only a couple uses.
WASTE of money & effort Don't waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed & so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &#34;it just doesn't get hard or blow hardly any air.&#34;  We're keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it's useless.  Again, save your money & skip this product
Blew up with in 4 months I bought it in May and it blew up in August.  It was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time.  Up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer.  Relatively quiet, high velocity, and effective.
Hot Tools - too hot! The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.  It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product.
Cord Keeper Breaks! I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware.
I've had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature I've had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature. The last one I purchased through Amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use. Thats just poor....
Overheated in 2 minutes. Over heated in 2 minute! We had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to Amazon. Good luck if you want to order this through online.
One Star Too Heavy.
Don't waste your money first hairdryer arrived damaged, second hairdryer only lasted five months before overheating.  Now what, I have no box to return the item but I am going to let the company know my dissatisfaction with their product and see what happens.  I'm going back to Conair!
What a waste of money! Bought 2 of these hair dryers. The first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing. Thinking it was because I dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another. This one lasted 3 months same thing. I will never buy conair again!
John Frizzy Hair Dryer I purchased this at the local CVS. It's supposed to make your hair soft. It burned my hair and made the ends knotted and frizzy. Someone else on here said that it knotted their hair, too. I'm so surprised at all the positive reviews. The button placements are terribly designed. It's heavy. The air on low is not low. And the low heat is too hot. Now I have to get a trim to get rid of the frizzy ends! Very frustrating.
Overheated I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.
Really lousy This dryer is definitely lightweight like people have said.  It feels really cheap.  The one I ordered wouldn't get hot enough (certainly not as hot as most hair dryers with this wattage), and the heat would go off and back on while using it. Took forever to dry my hair.  I'm sending it back.
One Star only one speed HOT Burnt my ends Had to get rid of it
Piece of Crap This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.<br /><br />I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.<br /><br />Thus, had to trash it.<br /><br />I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)
Basic, foldable and works Basic hairdryer that folds.  It doesn't seem like it is strong, but dries our long hair fast.  Downside is that our hair gets sucked into it and that isn't fun! Need a better guard on it, but hey for the price I just hope it lasts longer than our last one<br />UPDATE<br />Don't bother buying this brand.  We bought 2 of them and they both died within a couple weeks of each other.  I wish someone made something that lasted longer than 6 months! I know it wasn't much money, but they shouldn't build them to fail in such a short time!
stopped working after 3 months looks good, but stopped working after 3 months, It's beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money.
air leaks from several places, bad quality After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!
One Star this dryer was received on july 5th 2014 and stopped working on october 27th 2014. I purched two of these, I hope the other one last longer than 4 months.
Pretty but not a good fit for me This product had been used and packaged up. The dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low. I will be returning the item. I liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly
One Star very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.
Worked great for about a month While using it one day it all of a sudden sounded like it went on low, but it just lost its oomph and it never came back.  The next time I turned it on it ran for a few seconds then stopped working at all.  It had hardly been used, but I had it long enough that I couldn't return it.  Bummer.  I liked the idea of having it hang on the wall.  I hadn't even gotten around to hanging it yet.
Hand held with a hanger. I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on.
One Star Only used for few months and already quit working.
Worth it???no This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won't be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.
One Star I returned it.
NOT WORTH THE MONEY! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Im a professional salon owner and i bought this. Something inside broke off and every time it is turnes on it makes this excruciating click clank cling sound that hurts your ears while under the dryer plus the loud sound of the dryer. I have to use it on the lowest settings which takes hours upon hours just to dry.  I used this dryer 3 times before the problem started.
Buyer Beware of Warranty Stipulations I bought this for my girlfriend last year for Christmas. A little less than a year later the hair dryer's motor has malfunctioned. I called up the manufacturer, since it has a one year manufacturers warranty, and was told that they would replace it if I paid for the item to be shipped back and paid a $10 warranty replacement fee. I as the consumer should not have to pay for the warranty of a product that failed to even last a year. Other buyers, please be aware of this companies horrible warranty service.
not durable It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again.
No power. Combs and brushes were not right for ... No power.  Combs and brushes were not right for my hair.  The ends of the combs were sharp and hurt my scalp.<br /><br />Unusable, should have returned it, but I threw away the box.
Dies after a few months It worked great for about 8 months both on 110 and 220v. Unfortunately it's started making a weird buzzing sound after about 8 months and smells like burning. Dang.
Heavy! Works okay, but very heavy!
Caught on fire... Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again.
No warranty I would not purchase this item again from Amazon.  This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.
Ear Splitting hot air This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use. It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it's impossible to work or write while using it. It would have been nice to know this in advance.  All in all It's terrible
The worst choice I regret this purchased , 30 days and my dryer stop working.... Bad quality product , not worthy ... GET SOMTHING ELSE . I DONT KNOW HOW PEOPLE RATED SO HIGH
where there is smoke there FIRE! I just bought this and opened it up.  I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair. <br /> <br />I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking.  It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head.  I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire. <br /> <br />It is brand new and it won't work.   <br />Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes. <br /> <br />I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good.  The one I have isn't ionic and wanted to try it, guess I'll go back to the old one. <br /> <br />Don't buy it.
Not worth it. Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn't very expensive.
Total waste of money. Also, it sucks. I bought this dryer thinking it was going to revolutionize my morning ritual. Yeah, I was wrong. It dried my hair slower than any other hair dryer I have ever had and left my hair frizzy every. single. time. Then it died not 6 months after I got it, which was actually a total relief because I ended up spending $30 on the best dryer I've ever had, the orange Conair Infiniti Pro. Save your money & check out that one instead, you won't be disappointed.
I had to send this product back because the heat ... I had to send this product back because the heat holes in the dryer head are to high to dry the back and sides of my head.
Horrible Experience. It was damaged when received. Now I have to pay to return it.
Product is junk!!!! I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  I turned it on to high and the on/air flow button broke.  It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  I had to un-plug it and re-plug it into the outlet to use it this morning.  This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.
I ordered a 2000 watt Bespoke Labs' highest-end model to replace an expired Bespoke Labs' second-tier 1850 watt model, but... Bespoke Labs sent me an 1800 watt model.  My wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived, so I never had a chance to dispute Bespoke Labs shipping me the wrong item.  She likes it and continues using it, and I must admit it does the job quite well, but it was not what I ordered and not what I paid the premium for.  Therefore, I am giving 1 star as a judgment more about Bespoke Labs than the product I received.
Buyer BEWARE! Do not be fooled by all of the fabulous reviews for this dryer.  Mine stopped working completely after less than six months.  I contacted the company and they told me to send it back with a note saying &#34;defective&#34; and my address so they could send a replacement.  I paid $12 shipping to send it to them.  It's been two weeks and I have yet to receive a replacement.  I have contacted the company multiple times since to find out what is going on and I have not received a response.  Terrible hairdryer.  Terrible company.  For all we know, their company representatives could be the ones writing the glowing reviews because I don't know how anyone could actually recommend this product or company.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
Safety issue Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.
The brush on this is like a baby's brush it did not brush through my ... The brush on this is like a baby's brush it did not brush through my hair. Terrible don't waste your time buying. Price is great but brush isn't
Very disappointing I purchased the Yellowbird in September.  I only used it two or three times a week, and by January it was broken.  The heating element died and now it only blows cold air. I should have kept the cheap hair dryer I've had since high school.  What a waste of money!
not happy i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with it is no longer under warrenty - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer
Andis Hair Dryer Problem I bought one of these and it lasted 1 month. Great customer service sent me another and now three months later the same thing happened. The low speed switch burns out. Unfortunately this time Amazon bails out and makes you deal direct with the manufacturer for return.  I'm going to Conair.
Loved it while it lasted. I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.
One Star VERY Heavy. On/Off switch right on handle and gets turned off during use all the time.
PARABEN Disappointment Zero Stars!<br />With all of those natural and safe ingredients, Komenuka Bijin blew it when they added the very unsafe and unhealthy chemical preservative paraben.<br />Disappointed beyond belief!
... hair dryer about a year ago and it worked great until last week and smoke started coming out of ... Bought this hair dryer about a year ago and it worked great until last week and smoke started coming out of the handle around the setting select dial.  Wouldn't have another due to this fire hazard.  Fortunately, I noticed the smoke right away and turned it off.
Don't waste your money Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don't waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!
Broke Bought this about a year ago and recently it starting having green sparks inside of it and today it stopped blowing warm air. Very disappointed in the quality. Would not but it again.
Fried my fine hair I need to replace this dryer. I have somewhat fine hair, and this dryer is frying it on the ends. I'm going to purchase a Revlon tourmaline dryer again. I had one previously, which worked great, but died after a few years of use. Guess I was caught up in how cute this one is. If you have fine hair, stay away.
possible fire! I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.
Hair dryer IS NOT genuine - it's FAKE, BOGUS, COUNTERFEIT, GARBAGE, JUNK NOT AUTHENTIC Do NOT Buy! Yes, I was tricked into leaving a good review so that I would qualify for a replacement if the hair dryer broke within 2 years.  Now that I've had a while to use it, I found out it's JUNK, COUNTERFEIT, BOGUS, FAKE, GARBAGE, etc.  It is definitely not a genuine T3 hair dryer!  I pulled out my original T3 which makes a funny noise now, but it drys my hair in 1/2 the time that this new phony one does.  My daughter also has a authentic T3 and when she came to visit, she used my new one.  She immediately knew something was wrong with it and in fact got really angry because it dryed her hair so slowly she was late going out that night.  Amazon really needs to put a stop to people to obviously sell horrible knock-offs!  These people will eventually give Amazon a bad name and people will refrain from using their site to order things.  Convenience will mean nothing if the products are worthless.  If you have to again buy another hair dryer, you've ended up spending much more than going to a reputable store.
Didnt have luck with this one its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet
One Star i need to exchange it for another hair dryer
Not recommended. 2 out of the 3 attachments don't fit the dryer; very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  You won't be happy with this if you're looking for a professional grade dryer.
DO NOT USE!!!  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  SENT THE WRONG PART AND WON'T SEND A REPLACEMENT!!! I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time.
Yellowbird Hair dryer I purchased this item from Super Pharmacy Unica on February 26, 2013.  I received this item at the beginning of March 2013.  I have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving.  Yesterday I had to dry my hair ao I turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on, off switch.  I immediately turned it off .  I sent an email to the seller and I have not received a reply.  I have used Yellowbird hair dryers which I have purchased from other vendors for many years and I have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer.  Furthermore, this seller has not replied to any of my emails.  I want my money returned so that I can purchase a new Yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company.
Burned out within months I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.
Very poor Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.
One Star Stopped working and almost burned my hair from sparking at the base of the cord. AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS!
used one time! I ordered this during the holidays, with the knowledge that my current dryer weas gonna go anyday, well it did, and I just opened this and used for two days, it makes a terrible, terrible, humming sound......and I can not return due to that I waited to long to open it and try it now my return date is past.
Broke after 3 months of use 1-2 times a week for less than 5 minutes. I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.
I wish I would have read the reviews on this ... I wish I would have read the reviews on this dryer before buying it. I've only used it 4 times. The dryer stopped working after having it on my head for about 5 minutes. I can't believe it actually stopping working in the middle of me drying my hair. This is so unfortunate. Buyer beware!!!!
What a disappointment! I have always bought Conair products in the past, so I never expected this purchase to be problematic.  The dryer works fine, but none of the attachments fit tightly and they fall off with the slightest touch.  It's a huge design error and frustrating as can be.  I would never recommend this product.
It caught on fire. Quit after a few months.  I bought this blow dryer because the one I was using was 10 years old & could reasonably be expected to die soon.  The old one is still working.  This one is dead.
Loud, shrill, unbearable to use... I got this to replace another Conair dryer that I LOVED.  I wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of improving.  It isn't as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears.  Am returning it.
Too loud!  Ion damages my hair. I purchased this dryer at Target for $20.  I use only Conair dryers, and know that it is a matter of trying until I find the right one for me when the old one dies.      This one is so loud that it hurt my ears.  I know that I could have gotten used to it, but decided that it was best not to try.    I have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair- diminishes the shine.      This dries quickly and thoroughly, but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it.  I will go back to a regular Conair.    I love the brand, but just not this item.
Caveat Emptor!!! I bought this hairdryer last year on April 2 from &#34;iShopHappy&#34; and it's already broken...complete with sparks and a terrible burning smell.  Beware for fakes and Chinese junk...when purchasing hairdryers and in life in general. Caveat Emptor!!!
Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.
Stopped working after 4 months Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!
Too Expensive to Break So Soon Purchased this blow dryer hoping that by spending more I would get a better product. Afterall, it is supposed to be a &#34;pro&#34; dryer. Totally disappointed when it simply quit working. Just. Like. The. Cheap. Ones!  Also, as noted by other reviewers this dryer does get very hot and if you are not careful it will dry your hair out.
Worst hairdryer I've had in several years I ordered this hairdryer July 2nd and it quit working on December 2nd lasting just at 5 months. I tried hitting the reset thinking that somehow it had been tripped although I was using the dryer when it quit. I also let it cool off and tried again, all with no success.  I used this dryer every day to dry my medium length hair and it was the shortest lived dryer I've had in several years. All the other cheap dryers lasted at least a year or a little longer. I don't know whether placement of the switches to turn the dryer on and off and to change the temperature had anything to do with the short lifespan or not. I was constantly accidentally turning the dryer off & changing the temperature while drying due to this placement. I will never order a dryer made by Andis again. This was definitely not worth the money I paid for it.
worked for only 2 months I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn't start a fire!!
Guard your ears! I purchased two of these dryers, one for my daughter at college and one for at home.  Mine got everyday use, and it lasted almost 18 months.  I liked its small size, making it easy to store and nice to pack when traveling, but IT WAS VERY LOUD!  I'm sure that my hearing suffered from it's screaming airflow.  It was working fine until a couple of days ago when something blew to pieces inside and it shattered to a stop.  My daughter's is still working, but it only get used once and a while for travel.<br />I would NOT recommend this dryer.  My previous dryer, a Conair, lasted over 7 years with daily use.  (Sometimes even drying our long-haired dog.)<br />I purchased a new, full-sized Conair 121WFT Turbo in hot pink, yesterday.  It is so quiet and the grip is very comfortable.  I love it so far.<br />I would never go back to that ear shattering Remington again.
Horrible If you value your hearing do not buy this item.  It was so loud that the first time I used it, it was unbearable.  I was excited to have a wall mount dryer, but not worth it at the extreme noise it makes.  I put it into my yard sale box and sold it.
So loud - my ears crackle! I loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord, and I have always had success with Conair in the past, so I was so disappointed when I started using the Cord Keeper and found it was just too loud to use.  I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer.  I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.  It turns out it was the SAME model!
This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought I want you to send me a new one.  After 1.5 years of using this, it blew up on me.  This is the worst hair dryer I have ever bought.  Even my conair hair dryer from 15 years ago still works.  Please contact me to send me a new one.
Sparks! Bought this hair dryer in May, 2013.  After about 9 mos. of use, I noticed that the fan speed suddenly dropped to its slowest speed eventhough the setting was for the highest.  Then, I saw tiny little sparks inside the hair dryer at which point I immediately turned it off!  I've never liked the hair dryer, in part because it's positioned in such an awkward upward angle, causing me to twist my wrist to force the angle down.
Purchased it twice, both died suddenly I know you get what you pay for but this was ridiculous.  I liked the retractable cord and the folding handle so much that I purchased another one when my first shorted out.  This morning my second one was completely dead.  And I had a soaking wet head and 20 minutes to get ready for work.  It doesn't get much worse.  I'm not rough with it and each lasted less than a year.<br />This thing is simply not reliable.  I shouldn't have tried it twice.<br />Do not recommend.
I returned this one right away Said it had three speeds but it really only had two.  Temperature was either too hot or not hot enough.
Wasn't as good as I hoped. Not al all what I expected. Low air output.
Never even worked I bought this item and it shipped on June 9. I bought a place and finally got to putting it up July 12.  It didn't work; it didn't even turn on. I went online to Amazon to exchange it for one that worked, but they said my last date to return it was July 11. So I say don't bother buying this piece of crap; and be careful about buying things thru Amazon.
Waste of Money + No dryer for my trip!!!! Burned out the first time I used it with 220 voltage!  Worse than wasting my money, I was without a hair dryer/diffuser for my entire 3-week trip.  I was furious because the reason I bought it to begin with was that I NEEDED it to dry and style my curly hair!  It was beyond the 30 day return window, so it was a total waste of $50+!!
Great product if you want to get electrocuted. I really wanted to love this product. It worked great for about a month, then I noticed it started sparking! Initally I thought it was because I left it on the high heat setting everytime I used it; however, the sparks began occuring more often and I could smell it burning. I still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and I happened to be the lucky person who bought it, so I threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work. It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house & while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It's not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all. Use at your own risk!
hair dryer I used an Andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when I ordered it online, I got a different product.  The product I got is an Andis 1875 but it isn't the same.  I'm disappointed in the one I got because it's not as powerful as the one at the hotel.
Don't bother spend a little more and buy a quality product lasted for a few months and then crapped out would not be worth buying again only used it 4-5 times a month.
It worked great for about 4 weeks then it burned. This hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job. However, I bought one for my wife which I received on January 7th 2014. My wife used it 4 times and then it burned. Literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit. It could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer. But, my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise.
Died in 3 months!!! I purchased this from Target a little over three months ago (so, sadly I can't return it) and the heating element has already died. I like the folding and retractable cord features as well as the reasonable price, but it isn't a deal if you have to replace it every three months! I'll spend a little more next time and get a higher quality product.
bad temperature and flow control Heavy, bad temperature and flow control. It is not handy at all.<br />Bay Bliss hair dryer is much better and smaller.
HORRIBLE This product was just bad.  After I rolled my hair, it was hard to put the cap on my head.  The strings were supposed to tighten, but that was easier said than done.  The cap never got tight as i wanted it.  So this product was just bad.
Dirty and broken The dryer was, dare I say it, GREASY. I thought as long as it works, fine. Nope, does not work. The seller, hottest deals, should be ashamed of what they sent for the price I paid.
Replacement dryer Cool Shot button broke just like the first one. Edit #2: Again, the Cool Shot button is stuck in the on position.  I can not believe this has happened again.  I will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough.  Save your time, money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand.<br /><br />Edit:  I received my replacement hair dryer today and I hope the cool shot button doesn't give me trouble because I really love this hair dryer! Thank you!<br /><br />This dryer is very quiet and I am impressed by how hot it can get. Most of the time I use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast. I loved it until this morning. I pressed the Cool Shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up. Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up. Even if I barely touched the Cool Shot button with my finger, it would blow cold and I would again have to pry it back out. So now I am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold. Waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty. It's more of a hassle than anything, especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball.
Great product/Poor Quality We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time?
30 day max use They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.
Bad choice I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.
Buy the real one I bought this product too, to get it at a lower price. But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months. The serial number on the product was not legit (should be a silver label), so chances are the products shipped from Amazon are not real t3 hairdryers. Also considering the fact that Amazon is not a licensed distributor, you should avoid buying it because the warranty is not covered by the manufacturer. If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!
Blew Up in Three Months I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &#34;blew up&#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don't want to deal with.<br /><br />If we get it replaced, I'll change my rating
The plastic melted I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I'm not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.
cheap! This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I've had before). Great dryer!
One Star The heat setting is only two it said it would have four not happy
It has a cool air button which will not turn off now This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can't get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister's T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$.
Disappointed!! I read all of the other reviews for this iron and thought it would be great.  I have used a Chi for about 8 years now (both the wide and the regular 1).  This iron did not compare to the Chi.  Even on a high heat setting, although it straightened my hair it did not get rid of all of the frizz like the Chi does.  Also, I only have to pass over my hair 2 times with the Chi, whereas with this iron I had to go over it 4 times or more and still did not get the same results.    This iron was also a lot more difficult (despite other reviews) to glide through the hair compared to the Chi, so it took a lot longer to do my hair with it between more passes and slower gliding.  This iron was no better than a discount store bought $40 iron to me.  Very disappointed!
No cool button. The packaging was torn and taped back ... No cool button. The packaging was torn and taped back together. I am pretty sure I was given a returned item. I had a different model of this same brand and it lasted 7 years. I was very happy with it. I used this one four times and it stopped working. I can not find any help with returns or exchanges. This company seems like a scam.
Updated: 1 year review....Dangerous product ****UPDATE 2nd order****<br />As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit.
Dryer does not work good at all Dryer does not work good at all! The high setting is more like using the low setting No power! I have another Revlon Travel version I bought at Walmart for 12 dollars and works so much better than this. Very disappointed and waste of money. DO NOT BUY!
Hair Dryer Sunbeam is not worth a s***.
Like many other of the commenters Like  many other of the commenters, my Conair hair dryer quit working after 3 months.  Good luck with customer service.  They'll look at it but require you to pay freight both ways.  $20 in freight for a $17 blower!  Doesn't sound like a company that is serious about finding problems so that they can improve their future products.
Buyer Beware I received my product with great tracking from Amazon. I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future.
Disappointment I had purchased this dryer before and absolutely loved it until it died. I have been very disappointed with the one I received and would have sent it back if I had not thrown out all the packaging. The attachment it comes with- which directs the air and was one of the main reasons I liked it- will not stay on. :(
One Star It's like holding a jackhammer !
Eats hair! When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again.
Sparked Fire!!! Don't buy!!! Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!! Very scary. I will be returning this product. And I repeat...Do not buy!!!
I have relatively thin hair and this took forever to ... I have relatively thin hair and this took forever to dry it! I wound up returning it after one use!
Avoid at all cost! Only one advise: Avoid buying this horrible product!<br />I own several Andis pet clipper products so I trusted the brand. I was wrong!<br />I don't think Andis manufactured this product. It's just a generic, low quality dryer disguised as an Andis.
Died in less than 1 year Even though I paid more for this dryer than others I've owned, it died suddenly after just 10 months even though I only used it 2-3 times/week. When it did work, the long cord got terribly tangled and was a pain, so be sure you want that if you buy this. But my advice is to buy a different brand. I've bought many brands of hair dryers over the years and never had one die after less than 2 years use! Theoretically this was still under warranty, but it didn't seem worth the hassle to replace it (esp as I didn't want another one) so I chalked it up to experience and bought a Conair for less $.
Extremely disappointed. Used it once...and it doesn't work now.  I had to go the rest of my trip in Brazil without having a hair dryer.  Extremely disappointed.
Product stopped working after using it only 2 times Don't buy, product stopped working after using it only 2 times...waste of time and money...very disapointed...had good reviews but certainly didn't live up to them..
Almost set my daughter's hair on fire! I used the dryer for about a year.  One day I was blow drying my then 6 year old daughter's hair when sparks started flying out of the dryer.  I freaked out!  I am trying to get a replacement but the company is giving me a hard time because I bought it through Amazon and they are not an authorized re-seller.  Don't waste your money.
One Star very bad hair dryer, it stopped working soon.
it's not working, never stay on the mirror, fall don, and it broke my large mirror last time it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it.
High hopes with Poor results I have short curly hair that is both course & thick. Was hoping this could replace my hair dryer & diffuser combo and assumed it would be more compact. Unfortunately, this is almost just as bulky and doesn't distribute enough heat to curl/scrunch my hair WHILE simultaneously drying. I would've been better off letting my hair air-dry, which is a horrible look for me. In the process of sending this back.
Not Good Has no power like my old one.. Would not purchase again.
Awful Hairdryer ruined my hair Since I purchased this hair dryer my hair has never been in worse shape than now.....It caused the top of my hair to break off in several different places.  The A/C motor does not help!!! I'm going back to Conair!! Never had a problem with them!!! I am devistated!!! Do NOT buy this product!!!
This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer This is NOT a true diffuser. A real diffuser does not blow your hair; it heats your hair.  This blows your hair like a regular blow dryer. I returned it after a few tries.
Terrible shaving system I have been shaving with Braun products for 35 years, and have always been pleased, with the exception of the price for the replacement cutters/foils.<br />However, this particular product is awful, it does not shave close enough, and good luck finding replacement cutters locally.<br />Thankfully I saved my old Braun shaver, and as much as I tried to use this one (it was a gift) I eventually went back to my old one.
DO NOT waste your money! The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn't long or very thick , it's ear length. It isn't a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that's about it! 馃槖
Died within minutes Please do not waste your money like I did. It lasted me exactly  3 minutes. First it heated up and turned off automatically within a minute or so. I restarted it, but it immediately turned off again and this time for good. I tried to return it for a refund, but the status kept reading : we are waiting for your return or something similar. It is not the end of the world, but I certainly am a very unhappy customer.
It burned out in 6 months I bought it in the middle of December 2006.  Today June 18, 2007, I turned it on to use it and it burned out and smoke was coming from the vents.  The plastic around the slot the tube goes into broke twice..had no choice but to stitch it with thread to keep it attached to the plastic cap.  So disappointed with this product.  Don't buy it.  Better to spend the money and buy professional.  This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it.
Broke after two years, company wanted me to write them a check for double what I paid to replace. This was fine until it's 2 year birthday and then it only blew cold air. Company said that they'd replace it for $114- I paid $65 for it. I will never buy this brand again.
Broke after 4 uses When the product arrived the back peice was open but I popped it back on. It works good to dry hair like in the salon. However after about 4 uses, yes four,4, it started smoking from the back and never came back on. There was no warranty info in the box. Ive contacted the seller so I guess ill see what happens. Its been basically a month of owning this crap and it doesnt work anymore. Total waste of my money. Im very upset.
I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It ... I purchased the dryer about 9 month ago. It is alway stay at my home in one place. I occasionally used it and never moved it. Now it can not stand anymore. The plastic base and 3 legs are broken. I called the customer service and they said the warranty only for 60 days.
Sadly Disappointed I upgraded from a Gold N Hot 1200 for this one as was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, like the rest of the 1 star reviews, the dryer frequently overheats and then POP! it stops working.
horrible Doesn't retract. Very cheaply made. I returned the prodcut.
Fire hazard During normal use, the point where the cord enters the protector on the plug developed a bad connection such that it would only work when the cord was in a certain position. We had the same hair dryer before purchasing this one, and the same issue occurred, and eventually it just stopped working all together.<br /><br />This time around though...while using it, the cord sparked/shorted and started on fire in the wall socket. The dryer works well when it's not trying to burn the house down and the cord functions properly (if that's something you're looking for). There is clearly a quality control issue with this product and I'd suggest you try something else.
Don't waste your money I had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which I got. I was so happy that way I didn't have to be under a hooded hair dryer. Well every time I have used it and it's not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off. What the hell. Now I have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like. This is going straight back to the store. This is the worst hair dryer.  <br />                    Signed wet hair.
Used! I just opened up my package which I was very excited about because of the reviews I read. Well, once I opened it I found someone's hair all in the box and sticking to the plug stickers on the hair dryer. Also, there were scratches and dings all over the hair dryer. This was 100% used. I am totally grossed out that someone else's hair was all over a product that I paid good money for. When someone returns something it is not right to resell it so someone else. UPS is coming to pick it back up tomorrow and I am assuming I'll be getting a refund or at least I better. I am extremely disappointed and have never had this happen before using Amazon. Either way, I will not be buying from this seller anymore!
Do yourself a favor and don't buy this! I could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago.  It worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient.  I bet that if I still had it, I could plug it in and it would work much better than this model.  This model is such poor quality I'm shocked that someone would even sell it!  The unit is ok (after 3 uses) but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use.  I suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted, because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet.  Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer.
When this arrived i didn't even open it for a ... When this arrived i didn't even open it for a couple weeks, but as soon as i went to use it, it only blows cold air!
NEVER WORKED BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL
It was good while it lasted, but don't waste your money I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won't contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can't even dry my hair now.  It's like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00.
Second One We have had this model on our wall for years.  Then we started buying them from Amazon vice other catalogs/sources.  Two in two years.  Current one purchased July 2006 and broke Nov 2006.  These have faulty switches that melt and/or deform.  WARRANTY?????  First one from Amazon did last 18 months or so.
or maybe I need a plus size head bonnet I know everyone has said this dryer is awesome blah blah blah. I normally love Andis products, but this has ended their winning streak with me. I purchased this for deep conditions and to style my hair roller sets, twists etc. This bonnet is so small it only fit on my 7yr olds head and that was a tight fit. I really tried to make it work but after I knocked all my pink rollers loose, everyone got a hearty laugh I gave up.  don't know if they used small models for the design or maybe I need a plus size head bonnet either way it was a return for me.
HotTools Salon Dryer - not up to par The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn't fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it.
The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful ... The velvety outer coating on the hairdryer started to peel off after about three weeks. It rubbed off around the handle and nozzle, flinging bits of the paint (or whatever that was) into my hair and on my floor-- one day I tried to just rub all of it off but it just made a bigger mess.<br /><br />The dryer itself was just fine, just that damn clear coating paint looked awful and got all over the place. The only thing I can liken it to is one of those clear facial masks that you can peel off. I ended up having to buy a new hairdryer a month after buying this one.<br /><br />Buy another model.
Good looking but CHEAP! The Hair Dryer died on us after using it for a month. All style but no substance with this product. The slide switch almost came off and will not work. No air for my hair! The only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light.<br />Not recommended unless you want to throw money away.
One Star returned it
Dead in four weeks I joked that at $10, this hair dryer will be lucky to last one year. It lasted a month. By the time I checked to return it, I had missed the deadline to do so - by one day. Yup. This baby died quickly. Sometimes, you indeed get what you pay for.
Weak Not the drying power expected
Too heavy I didn't even plug in the hairdryer and try it because it was WAY too heavy. There's no way I could hold this thing for more than 1 minute.
Crap! the first days love it.... I didn't use it every day, just 1 day every other week... after 2 months, it started to smell burned and didn't turn on.... it is trash!!!
High Speed Quit I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.
Unfortunately did NOT last I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don't know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now.
Avoid this dryer! The unit started smoking today when in use.  The built in GFCI fried after just over a months use.
dont expect it to last much past the warrantee... These seem to work up until a couple of months after warrantee expires in one year. .am ordering my third so I don't have to fix the holes in my tile wall for a new backplate that may not cover it.
Fire Hazard ~ Don't buy!!!! I do not do reviews, except when I believe they are needed. In this case, it is needed! I used this dryer for about the past 1-2 years. Not that much trouble out of it. It did overheat. I would let it cool off and begin using it again. Then last week, I was using it and sparks came out of the thing!!! Yes, sparks! I couldn't believe it. I believe that this thing should be recalled, so I contacted Revlon. Revlon wanted no part of it. They told me to contact Helen of Troy. I did that. Now, I am waiting for a reply. I have also contacted the consumer safety commission. I am basically begging for a recall. Please do not buy this hair dryer. After contacting Revlon, I will not buy anything Revlon. (I am David's wife. The Amazon account is in his name.)
DANGEROUS My mom had two of these hairdryers, Both of them have shot sparks out the end when I used them
One Star Does not turn off.
Disappointed The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate.
Need Help with operation... Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you :)
BS thumbs down. so pissed Well i first wrote this product was AMAZING, until having it for a few months.  This hairdryer keeps on shutting off !!! Soooo annoying!  Prob not even real BaByliss
Not good Does not last.  I bought two and they both burned out in a few months time.  It was Waste of money!
Bad Product On and off switch broke after one week of using it.High heat was not that hot.When using it smelled as if something was burning.Would not recommend to buy.
Junk I bought the silver colored version of this at Target about 5 months ago.  I was happy with it until last week.  I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound.  The handle would no longer stay straight when I used the machine.  Like some of the other reviewers I found, upon opening up the device, that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken.  There was no way to fix it and it wasn't worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair.  So I bought a different brand last night.  I'm very unhappy with this product.
Underpowered To Use As A Hairdryer I'm not sure why the wide range of reviews. I bought this for my wife who has thin blonde hair. Before buying it for her, I noted that many reviewer said it worked for them and they had thick dark hair. There were also reviews of people saying it was way under powered and wouldn't dry their hair. So I can't figure out whether the quality varies from hairdryer to hairdryer or if the raving reviews are bogus. But, the hairdryer my wife received was too weak and took over an hour to dry her shoulder length hair.
shame on you arrived good, after 6 months in used, broked......  It's a shamed that product didn't last...Shamed on you<br />I don'tt have the ticket anymore.
First one great second one not so great! I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!
WARNING! From the start I wasn't totally happy with this hair drier, but decided to make do anyway.  (Too much hassle to return it.)  The toggle switch was difficult to use and when I wanted curls in my hair, for some reason I couldn't make it work as well with this one.  (Do the ion driers straighten the hair?)  The higher speed/temperature is too hot, but the lower one takes too long to dry my hair.    The worst of it started about two months ago when it started slowing down after a minute or so of use.  I didn't think much about it other than realizing I'd probably need to replace it soon.  Then this morning as I was drying my hair, I happened to see it in the mirror as it slowed down.  It was throwing sparks when it slowed!  I was lucky my hair hadn't caught fire!  Needless to say it has been discarded, and today (Thanksgiving Day) I have one more thing for which to be thankful - I was protected from a fire.
Poor quality I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised. The adjustment for height is hard to use the dryer doesn't dry the back of the hair, just the front.Also, it has collapsed while she was sitting under it , so not only doesn't it work properly but it is also potentially dangerous . I would definitely not buy this hairdryer.
Company does not stand behind their product This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.
Short life expectancy I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  Disposable should be added to the product description.
Don't Buy-- Product should be recalled. When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting.   There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark.  Buyer beware.   This item is probably not safe.
Was fine while it lasted...which wasn't long This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!
This product does NOT work in 220V This was a great portable option for travel within the US, however, as soon as I took it out of the country, and switched to the 220V setting and plugged in, it started having issues. The first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment. After that it just stopped blowing unless the &#34;cool&#34; button was pressed. Now that I am back in the US, it is still not back to normal, it barely blows at all, and the light is flickering and unsteady. Very unreliable.
nahh doesn't even work i dont know why i've kept mine for so long... oh well
I hate it I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer. It is so heavy and very difficult to hold when trying to dry my hair.  Also I don't think it has the ionic drying it claims to have.
Broke in less than a year I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable.
Fake Don't buy this product! It is NOT from an auth dealer. Amazon put up a fight when I returned it and it somehow it got lost in the mail so they didnt refund me. Seriously don't get sucked in.
Hair Dryer The retractable cord has already stopped working...probably haven't used the dryer 10 times. It won't stay out!
Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. ... Burned out about 4 months after I bought it. Total bummer. I have used Conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before. This one was a bust :-(
sent back Sent all eight of them back, they were to bulky and big, looked smaller on line, not what I expected at all.
airflow SUCKS You can't use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn't kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.
Heavy!!! Dryer is extremely heavy!  Not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers.  Buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying.  Returned it after trying it once.
Amazonshopper This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.
if I could give it a ZERO I would! R5130:    What a cheap piece of JUNK! You CANNOT take the heads apart to clean!!!!! I guess they figure everybody will toe the line and just buy new blades. With Norelco I could EASILY pop the blades out to clean it!    GOING BACK TO NORELCO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Defective or low quality? I am not sure if I purchased a defective dryer, but the first time I used it the motor started making a high pitched noise, and the air stopped coming out in a steady stream.  I thought maybe it was just warming up but the next time I used it, it did the same thing, with the air only coming out in puffs.  The motor was so loud, it sounded as if it were going to start smoking.
One Star Doesn't fold!!!!!
Stopped working after only 3 months I purchased this hair dryer on February 27th. The heating element stopped working on June 3rd (so it worked for only 3 months.) It will blow air, but not hot air. Returns not allowed after 30 days.
One Star Less than two years of use and this thing just stopped working. Aggravating!
One Star causes circulate every time!
Get the Warrenty I purchased one of these hair dryers and I love what it does for my hair.  The difference between the T3 and my Remington is a salon quality blow out and my worst hair day.  Only problem, a year after I bought it, it quit working.  I may have gotten a knockoff.  Since I couldn't register it, I'm screwed on the warranty and have to buy a new one.  I believe I probably got a defective one but for $50 more, buy one from Sephora where you can register it.  It's worth it!!!!
Fire! Bought this hairdryer about a year ago. When I was using it the other morning, it went on and off and went on fire. Needless to say, I am not recommending it.  Never had this happen with any hairdryer I've owned.  No stars doesn't seem to be an option, so it gets one by default.
Burned hair For months now, I've been blaming my flat iron on burning a large section of my hair- until today- when I was blow drying , as usual, and smelled something, then saw a gray spot on my head- upon closer inspection, realized it was a singed section of my hair, and as I ran my fingers through it- sadly, many hairs fell to the floor.<br />So the good new is, I can keep using my flat iron.  The bad news- who thought this hair dryer was so bad for your hair!  I have a huge section of dry, burned hair that I have been growing out for months- but always wondered why there always seemed to be new broken hairs with singed marks on the end.  Buying a new one tomorrow- but NEVER this brand again.
Does not dry my hair The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.
Medieval I have to agree with the critics on this one.  I used it and even the soft meshy side was too rough on your skin.  I bought a package of four I hope I can return three of them.  The verdict is still out on the Axe Shower Gel in terms of cleanliness.
Be wary- lasted just over one year!!! I have had this hair dryer for just over a year - 379 days to be exact and this morning when I went to turn it on, no dice. Dead. I have had ConAir hair dryers that have cost $20 last longer than this one,so to say I'm unhappy is an understatement! I don't even use it everyday- maybe 3 times per week AND last summer, I left it while I traveled for over 2 months, so the life of this this thing was seriously short. BEWARE~
Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection After careful review I spent the extra cash to purchase this hair dryer. I've had it for just over a year and it suddenly quite the other day. I doubt Remington will do anything since it's just past the one year mark. I feel appliances should last longer than a year. I've yet to see what Remington will or won't do. I emailed them today though I've read they have substandard costumer service. I just bought a 16. Conair since I figure it's going to break within 2 years anyway why spend the extra cash? It's working great so far and is much quieter than the Remington and the air is softer so my hair doesn't tangle while I style it. It also doesn't get blazing hot. It's easier to hold and it seems to be better for my hair. I love it.
Defective (twice) - do not buy I purchased this dryer and it was defective.  The casing simply pulled apart at the handle and the screws that should have held it together could not be tightened.  I ordered a replacement (which came right away, thank you, Amazon) and it had the same defect.  The handle simply pulls apart.  I don't think that's my bad luck - I think there is a problem with the assembly.
Only lasted 7 months I'm a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won't fix it because I purchased it through amazon!
This dryer sucks! I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn't really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn't find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!
CAUSES BLACK OUTS This blowdryer caused outages each time I used it so I had to stop and buy a new one!!
I expected it to be great, based on others reviews I was really expecting a great little hair dryer, but it was not.<br />It is super loud and overly hot and makes a bit of a grinding noise.<br />Just really did not like it at all, so I sent it back.<br />Still looking for a quiet, powerful, but not too hot dryer.
WRONG PRODUCT Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it's supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I'll just have to order from folica.com.
I don't even use it & never liked it It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, & that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  The dryer doesn't snap in like it should.
Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer a Bust This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back.
!!!!!*****BEWARE------AMAZON NOT AUTHORIZED******!!!!!!!!! My wife has had the dryer for 4months now.It started not heating up as much in the last couple weeks, now it just blows cold air.Went to look for the warranty caus' one of the reasons I bought this $200 dryer was the fact it had a 5yr warranty...NOT!!!!.....I started looking for the serial number only to find it had been removed from the box(you can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off!)  I came back here to check it out and found all these posts on non-authorized reseller bull$!!it.I do alot of research when I buy stuff, making sure I pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap.  There is no way to know Amazon is not an authorized reseller.This has been a complete rip off.Make sure you heed the warning....BUY ELSWHERE.  Make sure it has the serial number on the box!I'm really pissed about this.Now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer.This sucks!!
Too Hot To Handle- In a BAD WAY [[ASIN:B000K7JLGM T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    This dryer is dangerous, and doesn't work well at all. Yes, it dries hair. There is no standard temperature setting, you can just have high strength or low (wind level, not heat) and it is so hot i've burned myself and my hair on it. Because it gets so hot, it's own internal temperature regulator SHUTS IT OFF all the time in the middle of drying. The only way to turn it back on is to wait until it decides it's ready to go again (several minutes of sitting.) It is quieter, but who cares, if it's quietly burning your skin and hair? i am actively pursuing a refund, don't waste your money.
Short lived Died after only a dozen or less uses.  Smoke and electrical smell from unit.
Dud I think I got a dud it doesn't blow hot heat, my old hair dryer blows more heat to dry hair faster
Didn't Do Anything For My Hair It didn't do much for my hair.  It just feels cool on the scalp if you have braids.  I wouldn't purchase it again.
no cool setting I have been wanting a wall mounted hair dryer for a long time and this was the only one I found that had a cool setting. At least I thought it had a cool setting since the cool button is pictured and it is in the description, but when it arrived today it was the same model # that I ordered but the product is not the same. Very disapointed.
Out with a bang My hair dryer just blew up. I have owned many hair dryers but not one has ever had an internal explosion. It was aimed at the back of my head at the time so I'm not sure if there were sparks but there are large parts rattling around inside now. Can't wait to open it and see the damage. I used it maybe twice a week and it was less than a year old. Never again with a Revlon dryer.
This hairdryer started sparking and burned my arm I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn't smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn't worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!
VERY DANGEROUS I purchased this dryer about 6 months ago, and today when I was using it it started shooting out sparks. I looked it up on google and this has happened to a lot of people. It's even started shooting out flames and caused house fires when it's just PLUGGED IN and not even turned on. Just don't buy it, its dangerous.
Piece of junk After one month of use when I turned it on it made a terrible noise and plastic parts starting flying across the room. Vety dangerous. Piece of junk. Price should have been my first clue.
Don't buy this My old one had less watts and was much better than the new one. The old dried my hair in half the time it takes now.
Returning this I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/
I What a waste of money I used this dryer only a couple of times. Then when I turned it on it made a strange humming noise, started smoking, and there were flames firing up inside the unit. Yikes! I What a waste of money.
dryer scam Hi, I commented that I get the dryer is in the photo with carecteristicas they offer, I feel cheated and very angry, because I rely on information that you published the photo in addition to the product but it is not, the dryer sent me has nothing to do with what they are offering, I feel cheated, robbed.  are a very bad sellers, they offer a product that ultimately can not sell.
Disapointed, Low air flow, Not Suited for Salon Use I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back.
Seems great at first Seems great at first, but it's not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It's always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I've ever seen.
A NOTE ABOUT THE WARRANTY am in the market for a fabulous dryer for my natural african-american hair. I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty.
light, easy to pack, and dual voltage but became a problem I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.
Worst hair dryer/does not dry hair Worst hair dryer ever! After reading reviews that said this dryer was good for long thick curly hair I purchased it. I've given it a chance over and over but it does not dry my hair.  Stay away if you have thick hair!
awful Handle would spark when turning on and off
Not recommended. It doesn't get hot and the comb was ... Not recommended.  It doesn't get hot and the comb was flimsy. Very disappointed
Too heavy for  travel I found the dryer too heavy and bulky for travel and it didn't fold for compact storage.  Skip this one!
Are you kidding me with these reviews? I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  I can't believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  What is so great?  It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  That's it.
Too powerful. Extra features mean nothing. Too powerful on high. Not powerful enough on other settings. Needs a additional setting. Extra features (nano technology, ion, etc.) do nothing to change the look or health of my hair. The diffuser doesn't make my hair curly/wavy. (but the one on my old hair dryer did.) Going to try and return.
REFUND Do Not Replace! I have had three of these dryers absolutely fail on me. Even though it was under warranty and they replaced it twice, the last one overheated<br />and broke down again. Three times and you are out, so I will order another manufacturer. GOOD BYE ANDIS
JUNK My sister had one and I did too.  The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box. Both units did this. Do not buy. No, you're not going to be one of the lucky ones...don't buy this piece of junk.
Conair SB1 Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer I'm frustating too. I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can't dry my hair one time. Its terrible. Bad, bad. Dont have power.
Don't purchase I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.
Poor design, very flimsy This dryer can't compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.
Professional hair stylist review I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.
Worst hair dryer I have ever bought Came in a beat up box, clearly used even though listed as new. Different watt then listed. Then exploded while I was using it within the first month, luckily I didn't get hurt. Worst hair dryer I have ever bought. Absolute waste of money.
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.
One Star It only worked for 6 weeks.
electrical hazard I hadn't owned this 10 days when it created an electrical issue......the fire department had to come ...I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits and he assured me it was not my electric outlet....he believes it is the dryer.....I would like to return but now am being told by amazon that my window to return has expired.....not impressed with amazon's service....I should add that this is my third one by jerdon....and I have never had any problems previously.....obviously a lemon....would like it replaced for free....with a new one....not a re-serviced one....some one should agree to do that....
Designed by people who hate hair and like vaccums You know this WILL actually dry your hair pretty quickly. CONSIDERING IT RIPS IT OUT WHEN IT GETS STUCK IN THE BACK OF IT! Who designed this thing-Marques De Sade- seriously I wasn't even trying to dry my hair - I was using for shrinkwrapping the windows , when BAM! the damn thing sucks in my hair in a whirlwind of pain. That's when it is actually working , I know that its normal for it to go between hi and low power, but after less than 20 seconds its like&#34; can I take a break now?, Drying and ripping hair out is HARD!&#34; - it sucks- literally - maybe buy it for someone you secretly hate and would like to see bald.
Great dryer, but nozzle melting This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it's made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.
DON'T buy unless you want to burn up your hair or home Bad product started a fire throw yours away
FIRE HAZARD This dryer super heats, smells like it is burning and gets so hot on the handle you cannot hold it. It is a fire hazard and should not be sold.<br />Someone is going to get hurt. Since I cannot return it i will put it in the trash. It could burn your hair off or scar you for life.<br />DONT USE IT
Short coord, styling attachment doesn't attach I'm a big fan of con air and ION dryers in general. However, I'm disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.<br /><br />1) The styling attachment falls off 5-6 times during any blow dry. The latch or ability to attach is minimal. While blowdrying your hair, expect it to go flying and fall to the floor. Extremely frustrating and annoying<br /><br />2) The coord is very short. Unless you have an outlet right by your mirror and from waist-level or higher, you will need an extension coord to use this dryer.
The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months This is a replacement of the same blow dryer that I had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine. The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months. I have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and I think it too is going to stop completely.
I used it for 3 weeks and it broke! I used it for 3 weeks and the motor made tons of noise and then stopped.  It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use. I used it about 10 times. I was Sooo disappointed.  At the price it was not worth returning..I dumped it.... what a waste of money . I am so upset with this conair product.. You get what you pay for. THe plus is the bonnet was soft...I kept the bonnet and threw out the dryer.
Buyer beware This unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase
Just annoying to have to deal with this The cold button stuck on the 2nd use.  Now have to have it replaced.  Just annoying to have to deal with this.
burnt out The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out. Dead in under two years. I bought it for $26.75 two years ago on Amazon Prime and now it seems tripple the price! How is that even possible?
One Star The blow dryer blew out the second I plugged it into the wall.
Item not as described To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.
Three days of use This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don't waste your money.
I guess sometimes you do get what you pay for - in a bad way. I thought this would be easier to use than a conventional hair dryer that blows my hair around a bit too much.  My mother had a similar-looking hair dryer MANY years ago and I thought this would work just as well for quick styling, avoiding the need to blow dry using a brush.  I was wrong.  This is very hard to handle, hard to use to style your hair (well, my hair) and worse, the motor sounds sick.  It makes a kind of lame vroom-vroom sound like it can't quite decide it wants to be running.  I should have known I would not get much quality for this price but I didn't think it would be quite so awful.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill, as I think it might be functional, but it does not do what I wanted.
Used only twice before it died This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!
Buyer beware...fraudulent merchandise being sold and pawned as New and Authentic I've had T3 products before...my last T3 hair dryer lasted 3 years and change. I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.<br />Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!
Buyer beware - NOT AN AUTHORIZED T3 Reseller I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this.
Not a good buy Had this dryer a little over a year. Quit getting hot. I didn't use it very often. Did not last!
defective hair dryer 2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air. It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn't notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.
One Star Says quiet on description however it was the loudest hair dryer ever!  They should remove quiet from the description!
The on off switch is broken. The only way ... The on off switch is broken. The only way to turn it on is by pressing white button on plug and turn it off by unplugging.  Not what I normally expect from an Amazon or Revlon product.
Horrible This dryer is heavy and loud, I would not recommend it to anybody.  I was in a hurry for a new dryer so I bought it at retail store for 59.00.  Sooooo not worth it.  AND, the air is not hot at all.  It blows cool air on the hot setting. Also, the buttons on the side turn the dryer off while drying.  They were put in an awkward spot.  HATE IT!  And no, I'm not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something. And this, I feel that everyone should know so they don't waste their money like I did.
Styler No More I have used this Revlon Hot Air styler for years, but now they have changed the style and I will never buy another one. The new one has air holes above handles which dry your hair too fast and the brushes are too soft and do not grip the hair. I am totally disappointed and saddened I cannot purchase the old style and will not use Revlon stylers anymore.
Horrible The hood collapses. The hood does not stay mounted
Overheats immediately! Overheats REALLY easy :( It is light, small, cute and works ok apart from that... I would also prefer the tip &#34;thinner&#34;
Good for the price It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it' s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn't like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn't too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.
Not happy that I spent $40 Do not buy this.  Bought mine in Sept o1, 2014. Went to  dry my hair last night, Nov 8 , 2014, would not turn on. Only used this dryer maybe 6 times, only blow dry my hair if  washed late at night. To late to return to Amazon.  Six uses that is it.  It does have a reset and test  buttons which I  pressed several times. Still the dryer would not turn on. Not happy that I spent $40.00 for a hair dryer that I used only six times.
Gap between product and the wall when mounted. This does not mount CLOSE to wall. There is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall. You can mount it with the provided bracket, or with a screw through the back. Either way there is a gap that requires caulking. Not a small gap.
Never again!!!! I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago, and now it isn't even blowing hot air.  I have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again, just because of my past two bad experiences.  I didn't keep the receipt which is my own fault, but the dryer isn't even six months old and wasn't exactly the most inexpensive dryer in the store.  It just turned me off when it quit working.
Listen to the reviews ! this blow dryer is good at first but it's quite tricky. The blow dryer begins getting very smokey .. Something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn't seem right . I wish I listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day. A lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer. Very scary . Do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up. Waste of money! Do not buy this item. Going to stick to the cheap blow dryers. This was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts? ( 1900 ) only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a+ for that.
Should be a Zero rate [[ASIN:B0009XH6WS Andis 33295 Hangup Pro Turbo 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]  Motor would not start. Thus returned.This is my 3rd Andis as I love wall mount type in my bathrooms. Previous 2 did not last very long. Found there are other brands and therefore, changing.
Poorly made dryer I just got this dryer last week. You can get burnt with this dryer as the heating vents are placed in odd areas on the bonnet. Also the attachment on the bonnet (the one you hook the dryer tube into) came out completely only a few days after I got it. So I am unable to use. I will not purchase again. I did not purchase from amazon.com but thought the review would be useful.
Most annoying dryer I've ever had. I bought this at Target without looking up reviews... mistakes were made.<br /><br />By far, this has been the most annoying hair dryer I've owned.  And trust me, when it comes to a product you're going to be using almost everyday, you do not want it to be annoying.<br /><br />1) STIFF BUTTONS -- The buttons are flush with the surface of the handle, and they're intended to be slid up and down.  Unfortunately, they're incredibly stiff and difficult to move.  I have to use my fingernail every time (which is irritating and uncomfortable), and even then I often have to fidget/wiggle it around.  Sometimes it takes a couple of tries.<br /><br />2) ATTACHMENT FALLS OFF -- Oh man.  Ugh.  I use the concentrator attachment, and seriously, the touch of a feather is enough to knock that thing off the dryer.  Literally every time it falls off in the middle of use.  If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.  This seems to happen most often when other people are still asleep and I'm trying to be quiet.  My boyfriend is always highly amused at the #*$& that comes out of my mouth when this happens.<br /><br />And now, after about a year of frequent use, the dryer has begun to make loud sparking noises.  No visible sparks, just the sound... but I'm not about to wait for actual fire before I toss this.  I'd like to keep my hair, thanks.  I'm already shopping for another one.  Honestly, I'm not even that put out.  It's a relief.<br /><br />The ONE thing I liked about the dryer was its compactness -- because of the retracting cord and folding handle, it took up little space in my bathroom.
DO NOT BUY ONLINE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODCUT ONLINE - IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THIS PRODUCT FAROUK WILL NOT FIX IT.  THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT THE DRYER ONLY BLEW OUT COLD AIR  THIS IS A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION AND THEY WONT FIX IT FOR ME
it seems to be newand fine but never went this product did not work at all, it seems to be newand fine but never went on
This stuff is awful! I bought the combo pack for this which included the cleansing lotion, toner and moisturizer--- it was a waste of money.  The cleanser was worst of all, it was drying, did not cleanse well, and I broke out soon after using it and the other products[[ASIN:B000H3DA5C Almay Daily Moisturizer for Normal/Combo Skin with Grape Seed, SPF 15, 4 fl oz (118 ml) (Pack of 2)]].  The moisturizer is chalky smelling and not very hydrating.  I could not recommend this to anyone.
Definitely Wouldn't Recommend I bought this dryer on 5-17-12 and it stopped working on 5-30-12. Only used it twice. It overheats way to quick when using the high setting. The dryer started smoking and then starks start flying everywhere. Not to mention it blew out my bathroom plug. I definitely don't plan on buying this brand again, definitely not worth it.
Started lighting itself on fire I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire
Faulty Plug -  Seller didn't back their product I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug.
Worst purchase in a long time. This dryer is deafeningly loud, heavy and unwieldy, and none of the attachments fit. It's a terrible piece of machinery. Don't waste your money.
It only stays on high power for a matter of seconds at a time This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.
Conair Bonnet Dryer I like most Conair products. They heat up quickly and they are mostly very good products. But, this stupid hair bonnet dryer is the worst thing yet. Don't buy.
Unreliable Stopped working in 5 weeks
PLEASE, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! IT MIGHT END YOUR LIFE. I bought this product yesterday, and took it out of the box for a test run. Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.<br /><br />So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.<br /><br />I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I didn't wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would've happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????<br /><br />I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you'll know what I'm talking about. A woman on one of the sites I found during my search - search &#34;Dangerous Revlon Hair Dryer Malfunction - PlanetFeedback&#34; to see what I'm talking about - wrote that she actually got THIRD DEGREE BURNS from her product and is planning to sue.<br /><br />I'm shipping this thing back, and am never trusting Revlon again. Please, save your money (and yourselves)!! Do yourselves a favor and invest in a different product.
One Star brush too soft. gave it away.
to bolw or not to blow Cheep in price means bad performence. A little better than air dry. Not hot enough and no air force. I should have not been such a cheep skate and bought the more exspensive one.
Burnt out after a few months Started making strange noises and burnt out just a few months after purchase (we bought it in April, it's now September). Pro Beauty Tools offers an exchange but you have to pay to ship the damaged item to them AND pay a return shipping & handling fee. And from the other reviews here I expect another one would likely just burn out again in a few months... would have been nice otherwise.
Not worth it at any price Purchased in February 2014 and quit working in November 2014.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  And if Amazon were brick and mortar or had a phone number where I could contact them, then possibly we could have at least discussed, and/or they could have offered to replace the dryer with a working one.  It only worked for nine months; come on....
Terrible product I bought this product based on customer reviews. It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product. Doesn't dry hair effectively. Hood is so  high  you need to sit on a stool. The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn't get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair. There are no air drying vents on the sides of the hood. Top of the head gets all the heat.  Poor investment. We had to return.
One Star The motor blew out after a year and a half
Soft rubber cord last 1 Year, then shorts out causing sparks and fire. DO NOT BUY! As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel. Believe me this will happen to all of these units eventually if you use the high heat settings daily. I would definitely not buy this again.<br /><br />and<br /><br /> I would look for another brand.
It caught fire. I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.
dont buy it bought it, lasted a total of four months before it burned out and quit working.  had a sunbeam before that worked for 5 years.dont buy this maker.
Comb attachment falling apart. I purchased this product March 27. It is June 15. The comb attachment started losing teeth after the 3 use. The attachment now has a crack in it. Very upset. The whole reason I purchased this dryer was because of the comb attachment. I am going to try to contact the seller to see if they will replace it. It's too late to return. Also, it's actually melting.
THIS PRODUCT IS HOT! I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it. Here goes:    If you want a hair dryer that BURNS OFF YOUR HAIR AND CAN POTENTIALLY MAKE YOU BALD, this hair dryer is for you! For a waste of $18-$21 American, YOU TOO CAN BE A 21 YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS!!!! WOW!    This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING 6 INCHES AWAY FROM YOUR HEAD!    But wait, there's more!    Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR *AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/CAUSING A FACIAL DEFORMITY VIA AN ELECTICAL SPARK! YES!    The lesson of the day is: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER/PIECE OF SH&^ OR ANY HELEN OF TROY PRODUCT IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO KEEP A NORMAL-LOOKING HAIR/VISAGE/SELF. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S C-R-A-P.
SUCKS HAIR INTO MOTOR !!  SO annoying !!! I dont understand the great reviews of others.  This hairdryer is less than average to me.<br /><br />Cons :<br />It does not get very hot.<br />does not have a strong blast.<br />Slow to dry my hair<br />Sucks my hair into the vent on the side and my hair gets stuck in the motor.<br /><br />Pros :<br />feels heavy and substantial.<br /><br />But the REALLY annoying thing is that it sucks my long hair into the vent on the side of the dryer and my hair gets stuck in the motor!!!!!!!!<br />I have to cut my hair out with scissors.  Yeah, OUCH.<br />Who puts the vent on the side, anyway????<br /><br />Dealbreaker.  This machine is going back to the store.
Died after 7 months. Worthless warranty. Purchased 5/2014. Dead as of 12/2014. Perfectly competent (nothing &#34;ionically&#34; special) while working. We've gotten 4-5 years at the very least out of past blow dryers. You make the decision.
Great! While it lasts... The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The cool air button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!
not for travel after all It was much larger than I expected as it was to be used for travel.
Very disappointed. I will be returning The bonnet is very tight on my head. There seems to be no way to adjust. Very disappointed. I will be returning.
Poor Quality Big Hype This hairdryer shuts off after a few minutes because it gets so hot.  It was  disappointing because I was in Hawaii for a wedding and I couldn't use it. I had to find another one.  Never again.  Waste of money.
no warranty night light went out after 2 months,  i found out the warranty was only for 1 month..... this is a good product but the warranty sucks. <br />I am going for a full refund through American Express.. not through Amazon .lost in the woods...
dryer stopped working after two months of bi-weekly use This dryer was purchased last summer and safely stored while we moved. I pulled it out this January, and the low setting has already stopped working, while the high setting barely pushes out any air.  I'm now convinced this was a fake, and am sorely disappointed. Amazon is always our first stop for purchases such as these, and I've always been very happy with their customer service... I have a request for a refund in, and we'll see how this resolves.
Worked for less than one month! I received this hair dryer on March 23 and it is already broken!  No heat at all.  Not a good deal.
The voltage switch was broken... could not ... The voltage switch was broken...could not use it on my trip oversees.  Would not refund me because too much time had passed. Big rip off
Unsatisfied Customer I have curly, medium-length hair.I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz. After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn't stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn't as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair. And, although I did not experience the sparks, it short-circuit on me on a weekly basis.    I don't recommend this product to anyone, especially for people with curly, think hair.
Piece of Junk Don't waste your money.  Buy something decent.  I have had this dryer only around 4 months and it has burned my hand and my hair because at times it gets so hot.  Almost from day one, sometimes the high setting stops working and will only blow very low and cold.  Then suddenly it will work again. Well I am at work again today with flat hair because ONCE AGAIN the high setting and heat stopped working.  I'm done with this piece of junk.
This is a piece of crap! Do not waste your money. I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either.
Useless Didn't last 5 months. Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all. Don't waste your money.
BUYER BEWARE! DANGEROUS! BUY WITH CAUTION! THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON'T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!
Run Away! Don't waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk.  I am VERY disappointed.      First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!
Looks great but is very noisy. Switch very difficult to push. This hair dryer is impossible to turn on. The switch is flat and very hard to move. Additionally this small thing is very noisy. It is really a shame because the hairdryer looks very cute. I bought a Conair instead, also 1600W but it is really quiet and with an easy to push switch. It does not look as elegant as Andis, but it works so much better and I think it is also a little lighter.
Disappointment After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces. <br /> <br />I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair. <br /> <br />I would like to return it and get my money back!!! <br /> <br /> <br />
This thing BLOWS (and not in a good way) I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I've had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don't waste your money.
You get what you pay for Very uncomfortable, I can't have it on for more than 5 minutes. I bought it because it was cheap, but I guess you get what you paid for; a cheap product with cheap quality
Crooks! I purchased one to try. Then two more, the first on failed at at arrival and since I call 32 days after I ordered, not received. It has been used twice! They declined to honor this purchase? I have called five times to only be told there is no supervisor to make a decision? Them they tell me they declined it. But will never call or email back! The product is defective. The handle is burning up and burnt my daughter's hand!    Dissipointed!!!
Stopped working after a few uses It shut off and will not come back on.  I only used it about five times.  I think it got too hot.  I have another product that will do that but if you let it sit, it will come back on.  After two days, I threw it in the trash.  Waste of money and time.
WHAT A SCAM! Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  Don't waste your time or money.  It's Saturday.  My hair is wet and set, and I'm left without a dryer.  I've tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  I'm sending this back right away.  Amazon don't let Conair blame this on you.  This model is DEFECTIVE!
One Star Broke after two months. Heat function no longer functions.
Love it, until Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can't even open it to see what the problem is....
poor When you turn it on setting 2. Its smells real bad..<br />There are no holes for the heat to come out in the sides. Setting. 1 dose not get very hot..<br />I would not recommend this product to know one..
I would recommend buying a few levels up as I have had ... Broke within 2 months.  I would recommend buying a few levels up as I have had those in the past and they do not break.
Get the more expensive Conair dryer, not this one! I agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more. Adjustable? Huh? You can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer. I have the more expensive Conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids' house for when I visit.
I guarantee this dryer will be RECALLED! On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair.  After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy.  Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them.  They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.  They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either.
Waste of money Maybe I should expect the shelf life of a hair dryer to be less than two years, because that is how long this dryer will work.  I purchased locally, and spent $35.99.  It was ok while it lasted, but certainly nothing special.  Even though the Amazon price is lower, I would still say pass.
Defective product I bought this hair dryer recently and was totally dissatisfied. It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose. The dryer turned itself off periodically throughout operation. Save yourself frustation and buy a more expensive model!!
Not good for medium to long hair. Does not work with longer hair. The blow dryer sucks the hair in thru the fan and can burn it and cause damage. That's what happened to me and my daughter who both have long hair.
I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the ... I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke. Now I cannot find a replacement comb. If anyone knows where I can get one, I would appreciate it
DON'T buy it. Doesn't last! This dumb dryer was underused and it overheated. When I bought it only good reviews were to be found. Now I see plenty of dissatisfied customer reviews. Well I can add mine to all of theirs. Don't but this dryer. A cheap dryer I've had since a teenager still works and this one broke after 10 months of use at maybe 2 mins of use per day. My husband used it and he doesn't have long hair.... Very disappointed in this product. Seller would not take it back.
Died in 4 months I like the hair dryer itself, while it was working.  Mine lasted 4 months and completely died.  Now I have to figure out how to return it, because it says I am past my return period on Amazon and can't return it here.  Would not do this again because it is too much of a hassle!
worst dryer ever!!! I didin't purchase this from amazon however this is the weakest, worst dryer I have ever used.  I have owed several in my life as I have very long hair.  This takes about 25 minutes to dry my hair fully whereas other dryers I have owned previously it took maybe 10 minutes.  One of the reason I wanted to try it was for the retractable cord which unfortunately does not work!!!  I pulled it out the first time I used it and it would only retract about 50% of the way with the rest of the cord hanging like other dryers without retractable cords.  I would have to advise to avoid this dryer like the plague.  It isn't even that cheap for what you get so I can't see why someone would own this.  I'm def going back to babyliss.  Sorry conair.
Not worth the money I purchased the t3 featherweight Luxe dryer from a retail store. It lasted about 9 months. I contacted the company but because I didnt register the product, I had to pay another $55 to ship it off. 6 weeks later, I received a newer t3 2i model, but it didnt include any of the extra accessories that my first one did, including the diffuser which I use everyday!! Called the company back...and instead of just sending me a diffuser, they tell me that I have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model. In other words, another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that I need. So...by the time I purchase a new diffuser for $30 and pay the $55 for a replacement, I could just have bought a brand new RELIABLE chi or something. Don't buy the t3. It's more trouble than its worth!!! You can get a cheap one and it will be of the same quality.
One star is a generous rating The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great. It had lots of power on high. A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off. A few days later when I was drying my daughter's hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power. The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite. I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I'm just glad my hair dryer didn't throw off sparks or catch on fire. When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot. My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use. Don't waste your money on this hair dryer!
One Star Useless
Delete from Cart!! Unusable .... Bought for Mom to use to dry hair in rollers. The bonnet and closure is so tight and small there is no way to get it on or use it, even with small rollers and a small head!
SadBuyer BUYER BEWARE!!! This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase. Hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer, so that I can buy another brand.
ZERO coil left in cord after 2 years It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it's not like I'm trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It's been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It's like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn't have happened so soon in my opinion.
Dangerous, shoots SPARKS and FLAMES! Have had it for about 4 years and thought it did a good enough job.  I use it on  medium heat/blow settings and always clean the air intake screen at the first sign of lint.  However, it has recently been throwing out sparks and some actual flames.  At first it was a high pitched screeching noise, then popping, then sparks, now FLAMES!  It is in the trash and I will be looking for a better dryer.  Funny that my mother has had the same dryer for over 15 years, but this modern &#34;high tech&#34; stuff is just mass produced junk!
Got a lemon Ordered this dryer about a year ago from another site.  Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  It's a bit on the heavy side, and doesn't have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn't respond at all.  I don't think it's designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I'm out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that's comparable.
One Star Hair dryer blew up the third time I used it!
This dryer blows- poorly After much urging from my wife, she bit the bullet and spent the extra money on this dryer.  When it was working (little less than a year), she was happy.  When it stopped working, well, not so much.  And it's not as though you can repair these things.  They have no user-serviceable parts, outside of the little grill that your wife's hair accumulates in.  Don't buy the hype, and don't buy this dryer.  You can buy 8 or 9 hair dryers that will work just as well and cost less combined, and die off just as quickly, or maybe even not as quickly if you're lucky.  Why spend the extra money on something that doesn't offer anything extra?
One Star This i gave as gift & it blew up within one month!!!!
Don't waste your money Don't waste your money.  I mounted it and it's terrible - loud and doesn't dry hair very well at all..now I have to unmount again.
Hair Dryer does not work on 220 Volts! I took the hair dryer to Asia and while there, I put it on the 220 volt setting and plugged it in.  It worked good on the low fan speed, but, when I put it on high, the hair dryer smoked and immediately burnt up.  I had tested it in the USA on the 110 setting and it seemed to work fine.  This unit in my mind will not work in Asia without burning up.  It was either defective or not engineered to work on 220 volts.  My friend really needs a hair dryer in the morning and was not a happy camper when it burnt up.  I
Pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason I ... The cord does not retract. I've bought this blue dryer for years in the store and the first one I buy online doesn't work the same. Pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason I buy it in the first place.
One Star Died as soon as it was plugged in, despite having it on the correct power setting.
I have never rated this product by given it a ... I have never rated this product by given it a 5 star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!<br />Thank you,<br />Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent
junk,   zero stars I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air.
Do not like Terrible blowdryer. Scary to use as it sparks.
Burns out fast... I purchased this dryer in August 2013. February 14th the heater element burnt out. Very short life but great when it worked. Wondering how to return or replace?
Heavy, slow, powerless.  I hate it. IT weighs a ton.  It has no blow power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair.  Once it's dry, it's flat.  Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.<br /><br />I hate it. And I've replaced it.  Waste of money.
Does not work Did not work, return policy do not allows you to return. this product was defective, sucks I can not return it. Save your bucks and do not buy it!
very disappointed I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!
Worst Hairdryer EVER I know this is supposed to be the best hair dryer ever, but it's not. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine has never worked very well. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. And yes, I do clean the filter regularly. When friends stay over and borrow it, they always comment on how horrible it is. I look forward to traveling so I can use those crappy little hotel hair dryers attached to the wall, because they work better than this one. I don't normally write negative reviews, but I can't recommend strongly enough NOT to buy this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on a ConAir model, and you will be much much happier. Don't fall for the hype like I did!
Smoke I got this blower dryer for Christmas after I had picked it out and had it on my wish list.  I decided to make sure it worked before I threw away all the packaging.  As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell.  I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel.  I waited about five minutes and tried it again, same thing happened.
doesn't cut it Altho' they claim to be Dippity Do it doesn't come close. It left my hair very dried out and brittle. I have a bathroom full of barely used jars bottles and tubes looking for the elusive substitute. Hope someone out there can find the formula and market it again. Hurry, my hair is an unruly mess.
Much happier with the other purchase This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  At the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock. As soon as I got mine delivered. The product page shows this product is no longer available. Anyway, I returned it and got the Babyliss one. Much happier with the other purchase.
Junk - not a quality product I bought this. Broke. Decided to give a second chance because I loved how compact it is and it is off counter. I have had a new one for 4 mos now and my 2nd one broke. Says I cannot return so now I am out 2 dryers and spent over $70 - will never buy another one. Terrible product
didn't recieve I have not recieved this product so I can't give an accurate review. I would like someone to contact me, it's been over a month since I ordered this product.
not good for very curly hair The bristles on the brush are too flimsy to straighten very curly hair. plus this drier does not get hot enough or have enough air flow..it took forever to dry my hair and i was left with a frizzy mess.
Piece of crap It broke the third time I used it piece of crap
Won't stay in locked position after 6 months Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years.  This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down/storage position.  It's like someone broke it's little red neck.
Terrible! Two words: noisy and dangerous!<br />It is not necessary to explain noisy...<br />Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.<br />Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.<br />I send my back.
One Star does not turn on - very dissapointed
Hair Dryer Bought this to replace my reliable Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years.  This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!
One Star I don't know... Grat price but too weak.
Lasted 2 Weeks I absolutely loved this dryer. It was very nice and hot - and quit working at about 2 weeks. There was an electrical smell as if wires were burning, then it stopped working. Total fail. It's a dangerous dryer based on other reviews and my own personal experience plus a waste of the money spent on it.
One Star Blew out coils after 2 weeks of use.
One Star Used it three times and it died!
its a beautiful dryer not hot enough Because the blower dryer is not 3000wAtts is only 1800watts. And for the type of hair I work is not strong.
Not a good product Would not recommend this product. It is heavy, loud, and difficult to use buttons. Buttons do not change positon easily. Also it seems to short out my electrical circuit. I have already replaced it. Does not dry hair faster or smoother than cheaper, lighter versions. Would not recommend.
Paid for New but got Used When I touched the box I knew right then and there that something doesn't feel right. It didn't feel like a brand new box and when I opened it up my suspicion was confirmed. I have received a used or return product when I paid for a new one. The hair dryer had marks on it from previous use. I'm not happy about this.  UPDATE: I decided to use it anyways but it wouldn't even work. I tried resetting and testing it but it won't even turn on. The buttons are very cheaply made. When I moved the buttons it felt like it would fall apart. Very disappointed.
and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel ... I ordered this hair dryer to use for travel. The first time I used it, it caught on fire!  The manufacturer reluctantly exchanged it for a new hair dryer because it was after the return parameters. Really?  It caught on fire!  The replacement went on a trip to Europe with me and the VERY FIRST TIME I attempted to use it, it AGAIN CAUGHT ON FIRE! I'm lucky it didn't catch my hair on fire...and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel towel!  Very scary.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
disappointed I just bought this blower twice the second time that I used the head of the cord melted.  This is something very dangerous I could be electrocuted.  I don't recommended this blower and also it is very difficult to communitcate with Remington products.
don`t waste your money After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom`s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.<br />Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer.
One Star I love it!
Hair brush Brush too soft. The hair dryer too bulky. I would like to return it. I do not know how. Please, respond.
Disappointed... potentially dangerous item.  I won't buy Revlon for a long time I purchased this hair dryer because I liked the design.  Sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features.  I saw there were mixed reviews, but assumed Revlon had made the product well.  After two months of 10 to 15 minutes of use a day with the included diffuser, it spit blue fire and turned itself off.  I'm thankful for the safety feature, but have returned the item for a full refund.  I'm not willing to risk catching my hair on fire.
Disappointed with effectiveness. Thought it would be amazing for the price. Too large for travel. Hard to use. I have a $20 hair drier that works better. Don't get why it is so expensive. It  does not have a cool button
One Star Product description is wrong. There is no &#34;cool shot button&#34;.
This hairdryer is a danger to the user After about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound.  When I disassembled it, I could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound.  Had I not seen this, the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user.  There has been no recall so all the products are suspect.  Do not buy this product.
2nd failure This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!
Didn't work This product was very dry, it seemed old and really did not work at all, I do not recommend, waste of money
I don't understand the g4reat reviews for this dryer I made a huge mistake by not returning this hair dryer immediately.  The reviews were all terrific, so I just assumed I was not adjusting the ion settings correctly.  My hair is somewhat curly and I usually blow it straight, although sometimes I diffuse it curly.  This hair dryer has, without exception, left my hair extremely unruly.  It makes my hair appear very dry and unhealthy.  I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.  I've been trying to contact the seller, but have been unsuccessful.  I'd love to know if there is some trick that I haven't discovered!
It is not dual voltage It did not work in Europe. Every hotel in the US has a hair dryer. Why would I carry this with me? However we need it in Europe when we travel. Garbage!
Started on Fire!! DON'T but this hairdryer.  I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking.  It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard.  Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!
Poor quality for the price The exterior of this hair dryer melted and I can no longer use any of the attachments. Poor quality for the price.
almost like they were used BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM, PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW! IT COULD SAVE YOU FROM BEING BUYING A DEFECTIVE ITEM THAT COULD BURN YOU!<br /><br />When I opened up the package, the packing for the blow-dryer was bent and looked open. Despite that, I thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping. When I opened up the package, it looked used. The blowdryer itself and the attachments (especially the diffuser) were all scratched; almost like they were used. Still, I thought, &#34;Maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via UPS or during the shipping process.&#34; I wanted to test out the product before returning it. I severely regret even trying out this item before returning it.<br /><br />I plugged in the blow-dryer and attached the diffuser attachment. It didn't seem to blow air very well at all. My $25 Conair blow-dryer actually blows out more air than this did! I only had the blow-dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn't work. I actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot! I now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it. I can easily seeing this blow-dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody! I will never buy a 'Pro Beauty Tools' item again. The fact that this item was even labeled as a &#34;professional,&#34; blow-dryer is a joke. It blows no air and is cheaply made. The supposed $150 value is a joke, as well. Like I said, my $25 Conair blow-dryer is much, much better than this joke of a dryer<br /><br />Now I have no blow-dryer, a mini welt and irritated skin. Save your time, physical health and money and buy something else. Like I said, I can really see this endangering somebody -- whether by burning them severely (I wasn't even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt) or causing a fire of some sort. The diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which I've never seen before with a blow-dryer before.
Sonic Seal is a very apt name for a product that defeats the oscillation mechanics of a sonic toothbrush. The purpose of a sonic toothbrush to augment the normal cleaning abilities of bristles by moving them rapidly and also to generate a secondary, cavitation effect, removing biofilms beyond the reach of the actual bristles. These Sonic Seals defeat these mechanics of Flexcare toothbrushes by filling the gap that allows the brush head to clear the handle, dampening the oscillations intended to be transmitted to the brush head and sending some of them back into the handle. The Flexcare line is too easy to clean to necessitate a product like this.
Don't waste your money!! Three Conair dryers.  First one went on fire during use.  Second one didn't make it a year before the button broke off to retract the cord.  E-mailed Conair and they responded with lengthy instructions on how I can fix it.  Instead, I threw it away and bought the 260PX.  Although it worked well, it stopped working after 13 months.  I contacted Conair and was given instructions on how to get a new one under the limited warranty.  With the cost of shipping both ways, it would cost me the same to buy a new dryer.  So that's what I'm doing...just not from Conair.  Will never buy another Conair product!!
Great Professional Dryer - NOT! I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  I would re-done the review sooner but didn't think of it.  Don't waste your money!!!!
No luck with this dryer I purchased this dryer because of a recommendations from a stylist. She commented that she loved it. Before purchasing it, I read the reviews. Some were happy ,some complained about the dryer lasting a few days. Well, that is what happened to me. Upon receiving the dryer I noticed that it did not had temperature control. So I decided to return it since I did not like the lack of that feature. The company was eager to collaborate and refund the money to me even without asking me to return it. I was surprised and said to myself, wow this company is really different  from others, in terms of customer service. However, I used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together. The dryer lasted exactly three days. From the moment I received it to the moment  it stopped working. I was happy that I initiated the return earlier without me than knowing this unfortunate circumstance  might happened. I believed this product does not have a good quality control from the manufacturer, since more of one review complained about the same. From the reviews it would appear that the product used to be good and some  customers were happy with it like the stylist that recommended the dryer to me but  now it looks that quality fell very very low.
Not a reliable choice We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.
Bespoke Labs T3 SE Ionic Hair Dryer I was unable to keep this product due to the fact that the products box was not sealed and there was not a serial code attached to the hair dryer.  This code is necessary in order to register it for it's 5 yr warranty.  When I informed Amazon of this problem, they sent me another one, and this too did not have a seal and bar code.  This only leads me to wonder where are these dryers coming from?
not to happy I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product.
One Star It does not give enough power using the 220v
One Star It did not work
Finish on Handle and Base Cracks But Not Soon Enough to Return I happened to notice that the base and the handle has dozens upon dozens of cracks in the finish. It looks awful. This product is less than a year old. I have had other hairdryers for years and years with no problems. Since I didn't notice the cracks within the one month return policy, I cannot even return the product. Since I don't dry my hair with my glasses on, I guess I lose out by not noticing this flaw within the return policy period. If you don't care how awful the dryer looks after it has been used, this is the product for you. It's a great product but it now looks terrible. The folks at Conair really should step up to the problem and make things right with the consumers.
JUNK!!! I bought the Conair Pro Style 1875 dryer about 6 months ago.    I rarely used it, but lately since I've been trying to save money, I've started to do my own hair at home.    That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp! I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst part    The dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer. So while i'm twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i'm holding the bonnet up with the other.    PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!
DO NOT BUY Piece of junk.  The cord keeper feature is a joke.  The only place the cord keeper keeps it is outside of the dryer.  DO NOT BUY
Died after 1 week I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.
Pump is defective I bought this product because I had a lot of tattoos and didn't want to fade them, however once I got it in the mail and used it for the first few times the pump did not work and it took forever to get the lotion out of the bottle.
Stopped working after 4 months This worked great, while it worked. I only had it four months before it stopped working. The two speeds became one which was slower than the low setting. Of course, I was past the date to return or exchange, so I am back to buying a new one. Not worth it, unless you  only need a hairdryer for 4 months.
not that great I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.  Good thing I didn't throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months.  It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use it
doesnt work this shampoo never worked for my dandruff. even when my hair was wet i can still see the dandruff. this shampoo doesnt work
Greatly disappointed My husband got me this expensive blow dryer for Christmas after hearing me complain how long it takes to dry my long hair.. that of which I recently chopped 6 inches off.  I have a new baby, and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair - so this seemed like the perfect product.    I have long, fine-ish, straight-ish hair.  After giving this dryer a good week for a test drive, my hair only seemed flatter and had more static.  Just to make sure it wasn't the weather or my shampoo, I tried my ol' $20 Conair and the life came back to my hair!     Bottom line - feel free to try it out, but I'm spending my money elsewhere.  Also be warned about the serial number missing!!
It was a great dryer...until it caught on fire I had this hair dryer for a year and a half. I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Over the last few months it would stop and then start while I was trying to dry my hair. I contacted t3 and they told me to send it to them. I was planning on it until today when it started smoking where the cord attaches to the dryer! I turned it off so quick and tried not to electrocute myself. Sure, I could pay to ship it and give the company $15 to ship it back but I don't want another fire hazard! I spent way too much on this dryer to have it break after only a year and a half. Never again.
Broke right away I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half. There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power. The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air. No idea what happened, but not going to buy it again.
Edited after 60 days of this junk Hot setting should be changed to almost warm. Warm setting should be renamed cool. Same for blower settings. By the time this generates heat and air your hair will already be dry.<br /><br />Edit: After 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15-20 seconds when first turned on. What next sparks?<br /><br />Into the trash.
A total BUST!!! I would have gone with 0 stars if I had that option. I gave this to my daughter for her semester in Spain. She said it overheated this first time she used it and has been afraid to use it again. So this product was basically a complete waste of money. The bad part is I got an email saying the first one I ordered wasn't coming so I ordered a second. The first one came as well as the second. I didn't need a blow dryer to use in the states so now I have one that can't be used and I that I don't want
NOT VERY STRONG THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.
All hot air The unit quit working on the lower setting, and it blows more than it heats and dries.  It has basically quit working. My husband has resumed using our ancient one, which we can no longer hang up (which was my impetus for purchasing a new one).  They just don't make things like they used to.  We just threw it away.
Inefficient customer service Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.
One Star Good
started a fire This hairdryer started a fire in my home 3 weeks ago. It was left plugged in but not left on. It did not overheat. I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time. I set it down on a table and left for the day. When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle. Burned the table and the floor beneath it. The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  Please make sure to unplug your hairdryers after use!!!!
Do not buy I can't believe this. I bought this dryer in a local store less than a year ago and just a few days ago, it stopped heating. It just blows cold air. I thought mine was defective so I was actually perusing Amazon looking for a replacement for this dryer when I saw it on here and all the bad reviews. I decided to stop and put in my 2 cents worth.  The switches are terribly difficult to operate. I have to use my fingernails not my fingers alone. The retractable cord doesn't operate very well. But as another reviewer said, the folding handle is great. It's the only part that works the way it should. Also the attachments are impossible to stay on. You just tap them (as you normally do while drying your hair) and they come off and go bouncing all over the floor.  Hey Revlon! I think this model needs more work!
Garbage. No heat after 1.5 months of use I bought this in April, by the beginning of June the heating element went. I was drying my hair...turned off dryer to bring my daughter to the bus...walked back in -  turned on the dryer and there was no heat. ridiculous.
Very noisy and the cord-keeper function is problematci Very noisy with limited heating functions. I have only owned this dryer for a week and the cord-keeper function is already hit or miss.
Disappointing I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.
Hellooo??? I don't know if this can is expired, or my hair is too thick (it's not), or what, but this can did not do jack!  I sprayed and sprayed from dawn to dusk and nothing!  This is supposed to give your hair volume, correct?  Not just sit there and weigh your hair down?  Whatever, back to the beauty supply store, I guess.
Advice for other ladies I bought this dryer because I wanted to deep condition my hair and also do roller sets (for reference I have hair to my tail bone with curly 3c type texture). Anyways鈥?This dryer didnt even work!! I opened the package and all the parts were there. I put it together according to the instructions鈥? but then when I plugged it in and turned it on, NOTHING happened. The timer worked (it sounds like a cooking timer), but nothing else did. There was no air flow, no power light- NOTHING!!!<br /><br />I will be returning this, but I am yet to hear from the seller (this just happened today). I will come back on here to write an update and let you ladies know how/if they resolve the issue. I expect I will have to pay return shipping- but thats not fair given that I was shipped a defective item! (If I do- I will leave negative feedback).<br /><br />Overall the appearance of this dryer was &#34;cheap&#34;. The stickers surrounding the dials were peeling off once I opened the box, and the dryer hood wasn't very sturdy on the pole. Don't get me wrong- I wasn't expecting this to be a &#34;Mr. Pibbs&#34; by any means, but good grief- I at least expected it to turn on!! I must've gotten a bad dryer b/c the other reviews on here are decent (hence my deciding to purchase one). But ladies take my advice鈥? if you want a &#34;risk free&#34; piece of equipment then just save up and get a Mr. Pibbs. Otherwise you run the risk of being in my situation with a bum dryer and the possibility of having to pay return.
Should have listened to neg reviews on this product Broke within a few weeks from date of purchase. Would not recommend.
HAIRY SCARY! On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair! I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  The hairs were scorched and melted together.  My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair, I've never processed it, I never even get split ends, so that's not even an issue here.  I bought this drier because my last Revlon drier was great.  Never again! I've complained to Revlon, still waiting to hear from them.
One Star Burning smell had to return it after use
Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking. it never worked. Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.<br /><br />it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage.
One Star Awful sound and no power.  Returned it.
Bad design and workmanship! I had to send two back.  They both were broke.  One ran for about 30 seconds.  :(!!!!
3 months' use and now it's dead First, it's red and not blue. Second, it's large, very heavy and loud. Third, after 3 months' use, it died on me. Vendor offers no return/replacement after 30 days.
Button Sucks!! Buttons on the dryer are not user friendly, if you are planning to use often its not a good buy.
I got a dud Broke after a month and a half :(
What happened to quality control This is now the third unit in the last 4 months. #1 bought as a replacement for a 2 year old unit burned up in just a few days. #2 to replace #1 lasted about 2 weeks we are now working on #3 lets see how long it will last. Although I like the convenience of a wall mounted unit if this one burns up I will opt for money back and try another brand.
Blows out too much smoke This hair dryer blows so much smoke, it has to be unhealthy for my hair. When I made this purchase I was looking for a high wattage, ceramic ionic hair dryer. After the first use, I have realized that it probably has a high wattage but the other selling points may not be true. I have always purchased professional hair dryers and never did they blow out smoke like this one. I do not recommend this product and wish I didn't waste my money in such a poor quality tool.
NO GOOD [[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]] OWNED THIS UNIT FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND IT QUIT. I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !
don't buy this hair dryer Unfortunately, like other reviewers here, my Conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper died after a few months of use. While it was working it was excellent. But I don't expect a hair dryer to die after just a few months. Buy something else!
flawed My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.
Cheap cord, broke in 5 months, fire hazard The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap.  After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug.  Since it's more than 60 days, I can't return it to the store.  And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I'll just toss it in the trash.  I will not waste my time or more money on Conair.
Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme The real sham!!   Save you money!!   Nothing but slick goo on the lips.   NO PLUMPING!!
BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased ... BUYER BEWARE...... I purchased this March 2014 & originally gave it 5 stars review; however, in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire.  I reached out to the seller but received no response.  I had purchased this one because I had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years.  I have since ordered a Conair from someone else.
T3 Evolution Flame Thrower Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF. I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That's when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn't quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it's worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I'm going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time. All the best salons use Elchim. It's funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     I purchased mine at Sephora. So, this review is nothing against Amazon. Just want to get the word out there about this product.
WARNING! This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don't think it would last very long if it did work at all.
I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect. I'm not sure if it's this one that's ... Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I'm not sure if it's this one that's defective of they just don't make them like before.
Didn't Last 6 Months I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!
Dangerous....It caught on fire and burned my head and neck! I purchased this dryer and it has been a complete disaster...luckily I am here to tell the story. It is DANGEROUS...the dryer must have overheated...started melting and caught on firm. It caused burns on my scalp and neck...I would love to sue the company for a defective and health hazard product.[[ASIN:B0012HEGCI HOT Tools Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Rollaround Dryer with Pro-moisture System Model #1059 Sale!]]
wasn't what I expected. Thought it would have been ... wasn't what I expected.  Thought it would have been more powerful.
LOUD! &#34;You get what you pay for&#34;. Don't get cheep like me, this hair dryer  is loud! Even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the Infinity Cord-Keeper , it's the bigger that's better. The larger version acts like a muffler. Spend the extra $20 bucks. I did, the real deal is now on order.
Not worth the money. I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January high had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I'm stuck with it.
Broke after 3 months of normal use Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer.
I cannot recommend this product and will avoid Andis products from this ... I purchased one of these which quit working after a few months.  Andis replace it under warranty.  The warranty replacement lasted 3 months with use 4 - 5 times per week.  I cannot recommend this product and will avoid Andis products from this point on.
Disappointed Andis Purchaser After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!
Unless you like sparks Don't buy this item. I bought it after my Vidal Sassoon stopped working and this is garbage! I've never reviewed anything until today because  this was SO BAD. The buttons popped off, the temperature goes from hot to cold to hot to cold every 30 seconds while on hot and sparks come out about every 45 seconds or so. I'm not lying. I have  to use this at my own risk because I don't have a replacement, but I'm on my way to trying to find something that might not cause my hair to catch fire. Save yourself the trouble and go buy something else.
One Star junk... the diffuser does not fit on the dryer. My whole reason for purchasing this item!
Just Terrible I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.
Junk Don't Waste Your Money This product quit almost out of the box, returned it to Amazon, the replacement has been working fine. 04/16/2015 I spoke too soon, this one is just like the one before it, fan exploded in a dozen pieces. About 3 months out of warranty. I've had it with this model and manufacturer.
FIND ANOTHER BLOW DRYER My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.
Ion ozone is toxic Ion Electrostatic precipitators release small doses of ozone as a byproduct, ozone is toxic and can eat away at the tissue of your lungs.
Doesn't work I plug it and it doesn't work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.
One Star I didn't receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer.
Piece of crap It says that it's dual voltage, but it took about a minute to burn out after being plugged into a 220 outlet in 220 mode. Also, the mechanism to switch between voltages requires a screw driver, so make sure to do that BEFORE your trip. Because most of us don't bring screwdrivers when traveling.
One Star Quit heating after 60 days,
overheats over heats quickly, do not recomment
Cheap for a reason This is probably the 5th Revlon hair dryer I've purchased in the last 5 years. Every one of them has broken within a year, and of course, I can never find the receipt when I need it for the warranty. They work great when they actually do work, but be prepared for it to only last about a year. I guess you get what you pay for.
Not Worth the $$$ Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model.
Awful! Puff of smoke and NO blowing! Would give zero stars if allowed. The day it arrived, took it out of the box, plugged in and nothing. Just a big puff of smoke that smelled awful. Unplugged and it continued to smoke. Very disappointed in this. Thought I have found a trusted manufacturer and decently priced hair dryer. Back it went for return.
not good my hair looks so dry after i use it. i am very disappointed. i would of returned it but i lost the return slip!
Pretty Disappointing I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer.
So sad: -( I was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months, then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working.  The heating part of it just stopped about 6 months in. So sad :-(
Dryer Lights on Fire! I purchased this hairdryer back in November of 2012. Fastforward to June of 2013 and someone was using the hairdryer while looking in the mirror and it BURST INTO FLAMES!  Luckily the person threw it down and put out the fire but last time I checked hairdryers don't normally do this.
Normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment is still better... I was in the market for a diffuser, and I never bought one before... I will say this is the first and last diffuser I will ever buy. I'll stick with a regular hair dryer with a diffuser on the end.<br /><br />The heat in this isn't as hot as I would like it to be, compared to my normal hair dryer that gets really hot. I had to diffuse my hair on low, and this wasn't hot enough. Also, the low power was too low and the high power was too high. I also did not like how the air circulated in circles compared to the air coming out of a regular hair dryer in a straight motion. The circular motion blew all of my curls out (think if it like a fan you use to cool your house), and I don't have that happen on my regular blow dryer. I will say, that my natural curls are not very tight, and my goal when diffusing my hair is to help maintain my curls with a low heat... This did not cut it at all.. Not hot enough, and the way that the air circulated blew my curls out. I'm not sure if it is just this product or if it includes other diffusers like this as well... but I am sticking to my normal hair dryer with diffuser attachment!
I HATE THIS PRODUCT The thing that you put in front isn't their!!! and every time i try to use it it blow half of my hair the other half is flying up!!! hate it!!!
It is not strong enough! Doesn't blow enough air, I need to buy a better one. Great size and I did not have to wait too long to get it.
Cord wont retract The cord was hanging down and my puppies chewed it to pieces. Used one time what a was of my money
Bonnet Style Hood Hair Dryer As I tolld you before.  This item came broken and had to trash it.  Haven't the foggiest if it was any good or not.
Two months old and 2 of the 3 speeds quit! I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!
It only blows cool air now This blow dryer stopped heating up after 2 months.  It only blows cool air now.
UGH Did not like it at all. It gets way too hot and the piece does not stay on. Save your money and buy a better one. There are no heat settings so you are stuck with the hot one that eventually will dry out your hair. I had to return it :(
would not recommend this product Product gets way too hot.  The attachment that comes with it does not fit snuggly.  Have used it 3 times since buying it and I am not pleased.  Seriously considering returning it.
Inexpensive, with consequences Bought one of these about six months ago from a big-box store.  Worked fine for 6 months, although thought it was pretty noisy and 'high' setting puts out a lot of heat.  Then, it started to apparently overheat when in use, resulting in the blower slowing down and no hot air coming out.  Looks like a thermo sensing switch failed.  You get what you pay for!
Not Quiet Enough I am returning this hairdryer -- that is, if they'll let me; I still haven't received a reply to my request and it's been a week. I tried it once and found it had a high-pitched loud whine which my other quiet hairdryer fortunately did not have (Sassoon; discontinued). Also, the cords were too short and the light is way too bright.
Wasted money! I really loved this blow dryer however,  I have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working. I didn't use it everyday either.
Quit working after two uses I bought this dryer strictly to use for deep conditioning my hair after reading the reviews that it didn't work well for drying hair.  It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...I tried other outlets in case that was the issue.  It is a dead dryer.  I'm very disappointed in this product.
Don't buy this Andis blow dryer! I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn't until I kept blowing on it.  Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  I was going to blow on it, but decided I didn't want to risk it blowing up in my hand.
This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it ... This hair dryer doesn't function well after I used it for a month. It just suddenly became so hot and the wind was not as strong as before. Also it is a little bit heavy.
Piece of Garbage John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out.
blows warm now.  cool blast no longer works either.  this is ONLY 9 MONTHS old.. what a POS don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years
Broke within months I bought this hair dryer in March based on Amazon reviews. It worked ok at the  beginning but now no longer has any air pressure and takes at least 2x as long to dry my hair. The return period for this product is one month and now I need to purchase another new hair dryer. Very displeased with this purchase.
reasons for low rating The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something. <br />The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head. <br />After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head. <br />Whoever designed this product should be demoted.
Hair Dyer The quality of this product was horrible.  When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  I was very dissatisfied.
One Star I want to  return this because it does not have a plug.
FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn't impressed for over $100.
Won't last / Hazardous We have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year (coincidentally, a few months past the return window).  We loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall, are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized.  However, both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on.  The second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it.  These hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled.  The first time it happened, we figured it was just bad luck, but not the 2nd time.  There are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions.  We won't be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn't as hazardous.
very bad None available.
One Star retracting cord did not work after a few days!
This is unbelievable & infuriating !!! My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !
Simple and compact hair dryer I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.
I thought it was an anomaly and bought a second one like a ding dong when first one was shot and ... I bought my first one four months ago and returned it because it was shooting sparks after two months.  I thought it was an anomaly and bought a second one like a ding dong when first one was shot and it caught on F I R E  yesterday...F I R E...really, Revlon?
Failed at turn-on We purchased two Oster wall mounted hair dryers, model 76932-710s and they failed right out of the box.  Both units made a squealing noise and were throwing sparks out of the fan.  Customer Service at Oster will replace the units but after reading reviews of this model on other suppliers web sites, I am asking for a refund or credit.  The useful life as determined by the other reviews is between 0 to 3 months.
Not good for kinky natural hair Comb breaks easily, a little hard to old without touching all the buttons.
JUNK! The Elchim dryer is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned.  It is loud, controls are not easy to use, heavy and  no filters.  My current dryer is 10 years old and IS a professional model, much nicer.  I gave this one to our Abused Women's Center.  In asking beauty salons about it I did not find one hair stylist that was familiar with the name or had used it.  DON'T WASTE your money on this one, it is a piece of junk.
DON'T buy it!!!! I've bought this hair dryer for international travel.  It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless.... I guess it overheats but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it.
hard to use I was pleased when I first received this dryer.  But after struggling with it I now realize it is a bust.  The flexible tube fits into the bonnet with such a tiny turn that it is impossible to keep the tube there.  You must hold onto the tube or it falls out.  And it gets so hot it is difficult to hold.  I thought it  would get easier to use after a few tries but it is hopeless.  I hope no one else gets conned into buying this.  If it hadn't been for struggling with some surgery I would have returned this long ago.
DO NOT BUY! POOR QUALITY Worked for a while. Then, it broke. I bought it a month ago. DO NOT BUY IT!
Does not work. It never worked. Not dual voltage as it is said to be. Will never buy any electric item from Amazon again. Epic waste of my money
Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets ... Nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house!<br />Item RETURNED and refund awaiting! Do not trust it!

One Star Junk! Highly NOT RECOMENDED! It was broke for a week used!
sorry piece of equipment. Not as powerful as advertised.  Air force is weak.  For price you get what you get.
Believe the Reviews!!! I sent it back.  Basically not worth it.  Heavy - cord did not retract all the way -- not what I was looking for.
One Star It did not fir my hair dryer.
piece of junk I have owned quite a few Conair products but nevrr again. The cordless wonder has been a problem from the beginning and worked every once in a while. It is less than a year old. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought it because I had the same trouble with it. When I called for help I was told to mail back and then they would send me as new one. And in the mean time?The guy had no answer. Duh I have buy another dryer. I have learned a valuable lesson. Research products before you buy them. I wonder if the 20 something 5 star people are still happy with their dryers.
didnt receive Up to now I have not received this product. One attempt was made to deliver the product and no more.Now the product that I really need is apparently on its way back to the seller according to fedex. I'm very very disappointed to say the least.
Worthless paperweight after less than 6 months. I purchased this dryer less than 6 months ago and it's already stopped working.  I always plug my appliances into a surge protector and even so, this dryer's test/reset buttons just stopped deploying.  They won't stay pressed down and so the dryer won't turn on.  I'm staying away from Conair hair products, because of this.  Very disappointed in a product that won't last longer than this--especially considering how careful I was with it.
One Star First time I set it up the base where the wheels are cracked! !!
Not a good product Not enough heat , take long time for long hair drying, have to buy  another one which is more powerful
Very unhappy with this dryer. I wanted to return ... Very unhappy with this dryer. I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn't worth the trouble.  The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.  It will go into the donation box!!!  Don't order it!!
The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough ... The locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely. If I make a sudden move the hose pops off
poor It was damaged in a couple of months, poor quality
Where's the heat? Had it for only a few months and it already is losing it's heating element. Also the dial to change the heat doesn't work. The attachments are flimsy and get stuck easily. I can't wait for it to completely break so I can buy one that works properly. I wish I read all of the reviews for this product. Never again will I make that mistake.
Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I ... Very disappointment. I should have read the reviewer before I brought this dryer. Because of the price it caught my attention. but it doesn't dry the back of the hair. Terrible designing!!  That all I have to say.
Cord Keeper - joke After only 2 weeks of once-a-day use the cord will not stay extended. Solution was to pull it all the way out and tie a knot in the cord.<br />Conair products are now on my personal black list.
Amazing at first Amazing at first. It gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it, it stopped working. I had to re-place it.
One Star Light too bright

Caught fire!!!!!! Terrible blow dryer!!! It caught fire rite after I turned it on!!! You get what you pay for with this dryer, LITERALLY!!!!!
Can't beleive they are still selling these - they don't last I purchased this blowdryer from Amazon and it only lasted 1 year and I only used it every 2 - days!  Junk - don't buy it.  The retractable cord did not work after a while too but I could have lived with that...
box was open The box to the dryer was open it was missing the coupon that it was supposed to include. It might have been used. It was definitely opened...
One Star nunca recibi el producto. me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor
BIG LIE!! FAKE!!! Do NOT BUY!! I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.
One Star Too loud and the kind of thick! And for the price I would expect more!
One Star It suddenly can't turn on days ago.
Worst Hair Dryer Ever This is the WORST hair dryer that I have ever had. The one that Andis quit making, and I guess replaced it with this thing, was SOOOOOOO much better than this punny thing. Anything can blow harder than this one, it's terrible. The nozzle (I guess that's what you call it) anyway where the air comes out is so big around, what little air that comes out goes everywhere and you can't style your hair with it. Seems as though when a company comes up with a good product and it sells good, they can't stand it, and then they come up with something in it's place that is terrible and they think people should except their stupidity for making such a mess of things. I have had Andis wall hair dryers for years and loved them but, this one is the poorest excuse for a hair dryer that I have ever had!!!!!! Thank You,<br />Louise Bell
it costs too much electricity it costs too much electricity!!!!<br />i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product!!!!<br />it is quite too mass
dissapointed worked for 5 seconds then stopped working.  due to moving, this disappeared so I couldn't return, but i must have gotten a dud.  I'm going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying.
I waste my money on it I waste my money on it! I have thin hair and this one doesn't work with me, not hot at all! 馃憥
USELESS PURCHASE ABSOLOUTLEY USELESS. WAS SENT DRYER FOR USE WITH AMERICAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY!!! TO USE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY MASSIVE TRANSFORMER.SCRAPPED IT AND PUT IT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE
Very flimsy, feels cheap. switch almost broken on first use I really don't understand the good reviews. This dryer feels so cheap and flimsy. Almost break the switch on first use. You have to see it to understand what I am talking about. Don't buy it.
Dangerous! I had this blow dryer a little over a year, and I was never very happy with it.  It seemed to make my hair frizzy.<br />This morning, about three minutes after I began using it, there seemed to be a problem with the power getting to the dryer - it would stop and start.  Then the smoke started pouring out of the cord where it attached to the handle.  I quickly unplugged it before it completely caught on fire.  I have NEVER had this happen with a blow dryer.  Many other similar reports online when I looked it up.  I definitely do not recommend this product.
One Star Simply doesn't work!
Danger! Danger! Both of my daughters have/had this dryer and both of the dryers melted in different spots.  The dryers are fairly new and seem to be quite the fire hazard.  Obviously there is something wrong with this device since so many people are having this problem.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!
One Star I was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise. Excellent Excelllent 10 Stars
Please dont trust Conair Products Conair Hair dryers are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer for $34 and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack to send it from AZ to CA. Please dont trust Conair.

easy to damage! This item broke in the second time I used. I am totally returning it.
Caught Fire During Use after 3 Months! Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!
NOT PROFESSIONAL AS I EXPECTED. HAD TO RETURN IT. It wasn't as I expected.<br />I HAD TO RETURN IT.
so credits to Amazon Prime for being fantastic. Unfortunately I got them on time, so credits to Amazon Prime for being fantastic.<br />Unfortunately, the product was defective and didn't work at all. The material used is very cheap, flimsy plastic and the weight of it is disturbingly light. I do not recommend this product even for people who rarely use their hair dryers.
Light weight Works just like the big boys. Same power, light weight. I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag.
One Star died after about 6 months of use
Don't go near this worthless product. Can't bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.
Paid for new then received something used untrust Used item , hair in back of blower , I paid for new item , very disappointed
One Star I got the wrong one
One Star Way to loud, and it takes a long time for your hair to dry.

Well they refund my money but I don't recommend this product A non working product. Just west of time and energy. Well they refund my money but I don't recommend this product.
Dangerous! I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!
Really dissappointed The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat. The cord gets stuck all the time and is too short even all the way out. The unit is heavy to use. Gave it away after two uses.
The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and ... The most awful hair dryer ever. Very Heavy and the hot almost burnt my hair. Make a light weight product Remington!!!
